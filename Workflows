Frontend
 

Email Home View

The new design looks good, but with one change to the tag placement as described below

User will be able to see the following data

Email Sender Name

Show the following tags, with the Sender Name (and not the Subject, as in the new design)

Patient

Physician

Pharmacy

Email Subject

Email Preview (same as in the new design)

Time of Email Receipt

Email Detail View

The new design looks good, now add the below enhancements

User is able to add the Physician or Pharmacy

Most emails would not be tagged automatically from the backend, so they will not have Patient, Physician and Pharmacy tags; so for such emails, in the Email Detail View, give user the option to

Tag Provider, which can be Physician or Pharmacy (not both)

Once user has selected Physician or Pharmacy, they will be able to search for either using the flow https://share.getcloudapp.com/xQubeyBR (the search will not fill a form in this case but just show all the details for that physician or pharmacy so the user can verify those details) and then Save them for that email

Once this is done, the Physician or Pharmacy tag will be added to that email

User is able to save the email to Patient Chart for an existing patient, using this form https://share.getcloudapp.com/mXupokpR

User is able to create a new patient (which is not a new referral) using the same form as above https://share.getcloudapp.com/mXupokpR (remove Save to Referral option)

User is able to trigger a New Referral workflow for new or existing patients (as currently implemented for Fax Inbox), similar to what you’ve implemented here https://www.figma.com/file/RxKtfKm83tT9wOuWVVjYSD/Phelix-Web-App?node-id=4516%3A15022 (all 4 steps)

Consent Flow

Consent Flow:
At first point of contact, a carefully worded consent SMS will be sent. This consent SMS will contain text alerting the patient that if they want to withdrawal consent they can reply “STOP”. Once the SMS is sent, the word “STOP” sent at anytime thereafter, (n SMS later), will trigger a toggle in the patient MX noting that the patient does not want to be contacted. Before the checkpoint MX triggers any checkpoints, it will always check to ensure that the consent toggles in the patient MX have not been triggered. If they have, no SMS can be sent to that patient. 

Configuration of Consent Checkpoint:
Clinic will automatically have a checkpoint set up that is “On” by default. If the clinic wants to change the wording of the SMS or toggle the checkpoint off, they will be provided a disclaimer removing liability from Phelix. 

Logic For Sending Consent Checkpoint:
IF consent has not been sent to a phone number AND patient has not been sent consent THEN consent will be sent. 

ELSE, consent will not be sent. 

 

Consent Questions/Ideas
Should we give clinics the ability to turn consent back on for a patient (toggle in patient chart?)
