① Problem description
The clinics do not have the ability to setup virtual agents e.g. currently their IVRs are manually configured by the dev team

The virtual agents are limited to Phone IVRs right now, and important channels like SMS and Web Chatbots are missing

② Proposed value
Introducing new channels for virtual agents and automating the current channels would allow the clinics to cater to more patients

The virtual agents will also enable clinics to automate certain types of communication where a warm body is not required

③ Proposed solution
Give users the ability to create virtual agents which can be run on Phone (IVR), SMS and Website (Chatbot)

Designs - Phelix.AI 

④ Scope
Navigation - Main Menu > Manage (Control Panel) > Virtual Agent (new menu option)

Improve general layout of the Virtual Agent tab in the Control Panel

Clean up the menu

Three tabs - Phone, SMS, Chatbot

Once card populated per account (based on the type of account - primary, speciality, or COVID screener)

User is able to buy a number for Phone/SMS (via Telnyx integration)

Clicks on Purchase Number

Searches for numbers

Search results show up, or

No number is found

Search again

Chooses a number

User is able to assign the number for Phone/SMS

Clicks on ‘No number assigned’

Number gets assigned to that flow

Website Chatbot

Control Panel > Virtual Agent > Flow Builder

Background
The Flow Builder will allows the clinics to setup their own workflows for Phone IVRs, SMS and Website Chatbot. The flow builder can have three types of steps:

Input - contains qualifying questions for the patient to enter the flow, there can be multiple input steps; consists of a statement and response elements

Verify - used to identify the patient or the physician who is calling

Action - each flow will have multiple actions depending on what the patient wants to do; the input from the user will help determine the actions

Each step can have three types of elements:

Data - populates data from the database e.g. clinic name, clinic location, patient name etc.

Response - determines what path the patient needs to follow e.g. what happens when patient presses 1, or 2 etc.

AI - doesn’t impact the patient, but allows Phelix to collect data from the flow (activates listening)

Note - to see the Data and Response elements in action, try editing a SMS template in the Checkpoint Builder

To be added

IVR 

ex use case : patient calls in, wants status update on referral order (all automated in Phelix) 

Contactcenter IVR Studio 

4g style dev environment 

identify a point of contact (dial#, email, anything) that is receiving an interaction --- you can then route that interaction (typically routed to an agent) 

or can build call deflection workflow 

can drop in our own java script 

need to know how to edit IVR studio to inject our code 

and need to know the bound of what we can write in our code

RingCentral Meeting Notes 2021

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tovbECSYjKbs1oYys8dMYqzK3q5ut-vJ/edit 

 

Requirements
The first item will be the incoming phone setup using freepbx, for both IVR and real time TTS streaming for conversational AI and automated deployments via the Telnyx SIP Trunk

Acc to Mahfuz, incoming phone setup using freepbx is already done?

new short-term solution

Keep flows on PHP and run on it’s own container (instead of the Web App)

Aditya and Tutul will work on it as soon as the current migration and deployment is done

Backend work is creating webhooks for the VA - Flow Builder, Mike has mapped out what’s required, need a BE engg. to work on it

Reliability, scalability and dimensioning - Mahfuz knows what to do here

setup weekly meeting with Mahfuz (and Mike, Hassaan, Tutul) and kick-off the project

 

Phelix uses two SIP providers

Twilio

Telnyx

 

Old projects

We developed two Cloud PBX in Google Cloud, setup trunking with Telnyx, using which a user is able to make and receive calls

Using Telnyx SDK API, we developed webhook application to send Fax and SMS

 

current solution

currently we’re using Telnxy webhooks running on PHP servers

long-term solution

end goal is to use our own webhooks running on Telecom MX

short-term solution

use Telnyx webhooks on Telecom MX, and Twilio for Conversational MX

based on the load we get, we can determine scalability for long-term solution

new short-term solution

Keep flows on PHP and run on it’s own container (instead of the Web App)

Aditya will work on it as soon as the current migration and deployment is done

 

Note from Hassaan:

The first item will be the incoming phone setup using freepbx, for both IVR and real time TTS streaming for conversational AI and automated deployments via the Telnyx SIP Trunk

Acc to Mahfuz, incoming phone setup using freepbx is already done?

Example

PBX system at home

every room has a desk phone with an extension

Legacy system was manual switch-based (remember switchboards?)

Modern systems turn any server to a telephonic switch

In cloud if you have a Linux node, you can deploy your own PBX on top of Linux

If one user is registered on that server with a user id, they can directly call another registered user using digital credentials (virtual DID)

In an advanced setup, our PBX system can be used to call phone lines from third-party providers

This uses SIP trunking provide by Twilio and Telnyx (also in Canada), need to use Telnyx for Canadian clinics due to data privacy

Telnyx is the bridge between our Cloud PBX and the Telecom providers

Our own PBX is needed to provide Phelix users dedicated (virtual) phone numbers for IVR and SMS, called DIDs, and these DIDs are then mapped in Telnyx to communicate with Telecom providers (and used like normal SIM)

Using Cloud PBX we can prepare a programmable IVR menu, can also be used for Fax and SMS

If we plan to replace Telnyx, only config in our Cloud PBX needs to change, there won’t be any redeployment

Meeting Notes
Date

Notes

8th Apr 2021

Move current PHP Telnyx IVRs which are on WebApp to its own service/server

Create Flow Builder

Phone

Should be able to work with IVR hooks (like we are doing now with Telnyx)

scalability is important

two instance running on Asterix

if can’t handle load, scale vertically

Should be able to work with Conversational AI (layer in STT)

Use STT package of Asterisk to convert speech to text

Endpoint built in Python which consume this text

Website Chatbot

Use AGI/ARI for NodeJS

Use APIs to Purchase Phone Numbers

Need two MX

Telecom MX (existing) - interacting with Telnyx, Asterix

Conversation MX (new) - Handle all interactions with phone, chatbot and other channels (omni channel)

Mahfuz

DTMF input forward to MX endpoints

Setup phone number in Asterix, when DTMF values are entered, hit MX API endpoints

Setup STT package in Asterix, FreePBX

Sadique

Telecom MX

Use AGI/ARI APIs (NodeJS) to create integration with Asterix 

Build Telecom MX API endpoints which will receive DTMF values/input

Flow Builder MX

Orchestrates the path after receiving data from Telecom MXP; pass these values and IVR inputs to Conversation MX, process details, and send back to Telecom MX for IVR outputs

Handles interactions with other MX e.g. Patient, Appointment

User service mesh for synchronous comm b/w MXs

Mayank

Help Sadique architect Telecom and Flow Builder MX

16th April 2021

Sadique needs keys for Telecom MX

Mahfuz needs details on Google STT

Using STT in the app right now, need to discuss with Mike

Sadique suggested looking into MRCP (unimrcp.org)

Google Speech Recognition plug-in

Sadique suggested looking into cephei’s Unimrcp plugin

Sadique can add TTS (XML support) to AGI to keep everything in one place so we can use TTS in the flow builder

SMS Communication
 

Web hook of SMS PHP Code:

This PHP located in currently http://35.203.61.89/webhook/index.php

 

How it works: Each received SMS parse and write the sender, receiver and SMS context in a file named log.txt location is same place http://35.203.61.89/webhook/log.txt

 

<html>

  <head>

    <title>Text Message Receiver</title>

  </head>

  <body>

    <h1>Text Message Receiver</h1>

    <?php

 

    $json = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"), true);

    $from = $json["data"]["payload"]["from"]["phone_number"];

    $message = $json["data"]["payload"]["text"];

 

    if($message){

     $fp = fopen('log.txt', 'a');//opens file in append mode

     fwrite($fp, "From: ".$from.PHP_EOL);

     fwrite($fp, "Text: ".$message.PHP_EOL);

     fwrite($fp, PHP_EOL);

     fclose($fp);

    }

   ?>

  </body>

</html>

“log.txt” content:

 

SMS sending command:

sudo curl -X POST \

  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \

  --header "Authorization: Bearer KEY01740A0976B3A186083C57F073EEC1F6_9y8QxLA0apmYStJb4fFpqN" \

  --data '{

    "from": "+12892744859",

    "to": "+17733022294",

    "text": "Hello Blockhealth Service"

  }' \

  https://api.telnyx.com/v2/messages

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAX Communication
 

Call control created in Telnyx platform. Node ID of call control is important for FAX

 

Number purchased and route it for FAX communication in Telnyx

Web hook of FAX PHP Code:

This PHP located in currently http://35.203.61.89/webhook/fax.php

<html>

  <head>

    <title>FAX  Receiver</title>

  </head>

  <body>

    <h1>FAX Receiver</h1>

    <?php

 

 

       header('Content-Type: application/json');

       $request = file_get_contents('php://input');

       $req_dump = print_r( $request, true );

 

       $fp = file_put_contents("fax.txt",$req_dump,FILE_APPEND);

 

    ?>

  </body>

</html>

 

How it works:  FAX communication complete flow handle by this web hook PHP and write the log in same location file named “fax.txt” located http://35.203.61.89/webhook/fax.txt

“fax.txt” content:

 

FAX sending command:

sudo curl -X POST https://api.telnyx.com/v2/faxes \

--data-urlencode "media_url=http://35.203.61.89/fax/faxcontent.pdf" \

--data-urlencode "connection_id=1442091652352050535" \

--data-urlencode "to=+16474767017" \

--data-urlencode "from=+18722315372" \

--header "Authorization: Bearer KEY017424226F95D2A899A94A0304ABD753_FzPvkC5MRuRmHCS7bGPABG"
