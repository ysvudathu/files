Patient Journey Automation, Product description and overview
① Problem description
Most other tools provide very limited and rigid automation around appointments and journeys

Clinics has limited use for these tools because of lack of functionality

Clinics are forced to use manual efforts to supplement the limited automated tools

② Proposed value
It allows clinics to use zero code workflow builders to create and customize journeys across channels like SMS, Email, Phone, Fax using checkpoints targeted and patient and physician engagement

③ Proposed solution
Phelix is developing a zero code and fully configurable patient journey builder that allows clinics to configure and automate specific journeys and mini digital experiences for common conditions or cohort groups, helping to proactively deliver care. Clinics can select from existing templates or configure their own time or event based checkpoints, configure their own EMR inclusion/exclusion logic and rules, customize their messages and response flows across all channels, and embed notifications with fully customizable, temporary, and secure web links that let you build your own mini digital health experiences (like Shopify for healthcare), including identity verification, screenings, self check-in, appointment booking, viewing test results, sharing records, digital payments, and more, all without downloading an app

④ Alternative solutions
