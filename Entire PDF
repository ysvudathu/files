Description
Chances are, the information you need to do your job lives in multiple places. Word docs, Evernote files, email, PDFs, even Post-it notes. It's scattered among different systems. And to make matters worse, the stuff your teammates need is equally siloed. If information had feelings, it would be lonely.
But with Confluence, you can bring all that information into one place.
Getting a project outlined and adding the right content are just the first steps. Now it's time for your team to weigh in. Confluence makes it easy to discuss your work - with your team, your boss, or your entire company - in the same place where you organized and created it.

      Know your spaces
Everything your team is working on - meeting notes and agendas, project plans and timelines, technical documentation and more - is located in a space; it's home base for your team.
Think of pages as a New Age "document." If Word docs were rotary phones, Confluence pages would be smart phones. A smart phone still makes calls (like their rotary counterparts), but it can do so much more than that

 A small team should plan to have a space for the team, and a space for each big project. If you'll be working in Confluence with several other teams and departments, we recommend a space for each team as well as a space for each major cross-team project. The key is to think of a space as the container that holds all the important stuff - like pages, files, and blog posts - a team, group, or project needs to work.
Know your pages
If you're working on something related to your team - project plans, product requirements, blog posts, internal communications, you name it - create and store it in a Confluence page. Confluence pages offer a lot of flexibility in creating and storing information, and there are a number of useful page templates included to get you started, like the meeting notes template. Your spaces should be filled with pages that document your business processes, outline your plans, contain your files, and report on your progress. The more you learn to do in Confluence (adding tables and graphs, or embedding video and links are great places to start), the more engaging and helpful your pages will become.

 Content Writer Mission Statement
The Phelix content team aims to create accurate, comprehensive, scalable and engaging knowledge which can be readily understood by all Phelix users.
We strive to deliver this knowledge through multiple channels and learning styles, to make complex goals attainable.
Vision
A product content writer is responsible for documenting the product for Phelix customers, partners, and staff. The first and foremost job of a writer is to facilitate the distribution of knowledge to their audience. Dissemination, refinement, and creation of that knowledge forms the backbone of the product content writer role.
Qualities of a Product Content Writer
Communication
Content writers posses excellent communication skills. The written word is their bread and butter, and they are able to explain complex ideas and processes comprehensively and with clarity. They can also adapt their content to the audience and medium in which the content is presented to impart their knowledge and achieve the goal their readers wish to achieve.
Attention to Detail
Content writers have access to many resources during product development and it's life cycle. Writers are able to identify valuable information from multiple different sources, be it a Jira ticket, support case, conversation, or slack message, and apply it contextually to their content. Writers also understand design and the user experience. Their content is easy to digest and visually appealing.
Technical Knowledge
Phelix is a large system, with many moving parts. Content writers understand the techniques and best practices of users, and can present their content in a manner that aligns with readers expectations. Writers make connections between different processes and understand the developers intentions. They analyse this information to produce user story based content as an extension of the product.
Problem Solving
Writers understand the customer's perspective, and produce content that guides their readers logically and naturally. They spot potential problems or pain points, and provide the solutions needed to mitigate or lessen their impact.
   29

 Flexible
Content writers adjust their schedules to quickly focus on new tasks and meet the needs of an agile development environment. They can assess and prioritise the needs of their audience to dedicate their resources to where it will have the most impact.
Approachable
Content writers rely on strong relationships with the product, support and other teams to stay abreast of changes and issues. Writers are friendly and personable, so that other staff feel comfortable bringing issues to their attention. Writers are attentive and work with other teams to find satisfactory solutions.
Where does the Product Content Writer role sit?
Product content writers are uniquely positioned to liaise with most teams and roles in the organisation. They act as a funnel to disseminate information from the product owners (and their teams) and communicate it to customer facing roles. The below diagram shows a formalised flow of information from the product team through content writers, to other teams. In practice this isn't always the case, as product owners and developers at Phelix are very accessible and open to responding with other teams when the situation dictates.
Factors of Input
It's not the job of content writers to know everything about the products they write about. Granted, their position and qualities mean they're privy to a great deal of information, but they must also take input from different sources with a more in depth knowledge of a topic. The below diagram shows the different internal and external factors that contribute to content creation and updates.

 Developer
Vision
A developer has the immense responsibility of building the Product for our customers. Therefore, the first and foremost job of a developer is to constantly deliver value for them with very high quality levels in order to delight them.
It requires a great degree of attention to detail as well as analytical and problem solving skills. It is also very important to have business acumen as the developer needs to understand the big picture, the problems we are trying to solve and the fact that our resources are limited (both time and money).
Where does the Developer role sit?
Seniority levels
Spheres of control, influence and concern
As a Developer (just as any other Phelixian really), your sphere of concern should be the wellbeing of the company. However, not everything relating to the company's wellbeing is under your control or even your influence.
 33

      Your sphere of influence is the one you should strive to extend.
The objective is to grow your influence in order to increase the overlap with your sphere of concern. It'll

 Product Manager
Product managers at Phelix wear many hats. First and foremost, you are a member of a cross-functional product development team—a team which you will work to support in a number of ways with your experience with business, retail and technology.
Product managers are responsible for ensuring:
Their team is rallied behind a unified vision and each member thoroughly understands the impact this vision has on the team, Phelix,
Phelix’s customers and our industry.
Outcomes are prioritised over outputs and scope is lean enough to deliver value without unnecessary investment.
The product(s) they represent have clearly-defined value propositions which are thoroughly understood by each member of their team as well as all internal and external stakeholders.
Initiatives are properly scrutinised and considered before they commence and the appropriate documentation (e.g., an initiative brief) has been completed.
Customer engagement (e.g., customer interviews, site visits) within their team is frequent and productive. Customer needs are considered and form the basis of decision making within the team.
Upcoming work and progress on work is shared frequently and clearly with the wider organisation, particularly key stakeholders.
Data is intelligently and transparently consulted to aid decision making wherever possible.
Features and products are released with minimal friction.
The business (e.g., sales, marketing, customer support) has an understanding of their product and its features and is capable to support and sell it.
Competencies of a Product Manager
This is a 2-dimensional spectrum of competencies and Product Managers will naturally place somewhere onto this grid (strategic vs tactical, and external vs internal). Not every good Product Manager would have all of these skills.
Generally speaking, junior Product Managers whose day-to-day centres around the “heads down” Product Owner work for their scrum team will likely be strong in the bottom half of the skills, and if they’re working on a B2C product that likely leans to the bottom-left. An internal tools Product Manager likely skews to the bottom-right. Conversely, more senior product leaders will generally be “heads up” and focusing on the top half, focusing on strategy. Again, however, consumer-facing product leaders will generally skew to the upper-left, whereas technical product leaders will focus in the upper right.
 36

 Orthogonal competencies
Perhaps the most common orthogonal skill Product Managers must pick up, is that of the Project Manager. Particularly in the Product Owner capacity, it is far too easy (and sometimes necessary) for Product Managers to act as the coordinator for their team. Unfortunately, there is no end to the amount of coordination work that is needed and ‘urgent’ often takes priority over ‘important’, which means the Product Manager can end up spending less and less time on actual Product work if they’re not careful. Other skills that are sometimes adopted to fill a gap are UX and Analytics, Product Operations, Product Marketing.
Role components
Build, measure & learn to make complex easy.
Help your team to define problem-centric initiatives, user stories and tasks, aligned to the vision, values and measures to which your team is aligned.
Define success and failure measures, and ensure every completed task and initiative is measured and assessed by this criteria. Document and share learnings with your team and the wider business.
Demonstrate and reflect on value delivered, or undelivered.
Encourage your team to embrace complexity and our mission to make things easy, not simple.
Encourage a culture of learning and sharing. Every initiative or task is an experiment to be validated. Bring value to market
Your team is accountable for the adoption and utilisation of the products and features you develop. The buck stops with you, so you need to:
Ensure the wider business understands how your product works, who it’s intended for and the benefits it delivers. Work with our capability team, and personally involve yourself in efforts to demonstrate and expose what you are building.
Provide Marketing and Sales with the information they require to execute launch campaigns and ongoing marketing/sales efforts. Test solutions with customers and prospects.
Accurately measure the adoption of your product and make sure other teams, such as Marketing and Sales, are keeping track of the right information throughout the onboarding pipeline.
 37

 Practice radical transparency with your Marketing & Sales colleagues, especially when it comes to data and other information you may have special access to as a result of your technical competency.
Co-ordinate releases.
Communication and visualisation
In case it’s not already apparent—transparency is key. You are responsible for:
Clearly and regularly communicating development milestones, key decisions and customer insights, to stakeholders. Experimenting with and finding effective ways to visualise and disseminate information.
Keep your team in the loop. We work hard to give our teams as much autonomy as possible, but sometimes priorities will change for reasons outside of their control. You need to ensure they don’t feel caught off guard.
You are the face of your product(s) and will be required to regularly represent your product(s) to various audiences including your team, the wider business, partners, customers, prospects and industry peers.
Be frugal and pragmatic
It’s easy to overspend on both time and people power. Understand that:
Resources may be tight.
Investments of time and money must be rationalised.
The Technology Leadership Team will do it’s best to ensure resourcing between teams is appropriate, but you need to be a trusted advisor to these people. You have privileged access and insight on the capabilities and capacity of your team and you need to make clear and regular recommendations regarding team resourcing.
Customer intimacy
You must bridge the gap between your team and the customer:
Engage with those who speak more regularly with customers (e.g., customer success, support, sales). Cut out the middleman. Go see your customers in person and contact them over the phone.
Find quantitative ways to engage. Interviews and surveys are great, but also consider how you can analyse the data we have (e.g., support tickets, ideas, phone calls, bug submissions) to meet the market.
Expectations What is expected?
Lead by example. Some members of your team may have limited experience when it comes to customer engagement, stakeholder management and product strategy.
Get your hands dirty. You will need to wear many hats. Sometimes, you’ll need to deal with things you’re not typically exposed to. The buck stops with you, so if someone needs to pick up the phone and talk to a customer to resolve an issue, put your hand up.
Represent the business and the user, but don’t monopolise your insights. Don’t just represent the needs of external parties— expose your team to these parties. Your team should be able to prioritise work without you.
What is not expected?
Don’t be a dictator. Encourage your team to act with agency and get involved in decision making. Trust the expertise of your team members and let them make technical decisions.

 Tech Lead
Vision
A Technical Lead has the responsibility to help the team move forward. The person assigned to the role, is someone who has sound technical experience and strong communication skills. They bring a unique blend of leadership and management skills applied in a technical context with a team of developers and take on traits that other roles such as a Team Lead, Architect or Development Manager. He or she will be accountable for the technical direction of the project or product and serve as the go-to person for cross-team interactions.
Role components
The role is mainly composed of technical and leadership elements.
From a technical standpoint, the team is mainly focused on the now (development), whereas the tech lead also needs to look ahead and focus on the future (architecture/solution design) which is why the tech lead is the gatekeeper of code and solution design quality.
 From a leadership perspective, the main function of the tech lead is to help the team deliver. This is accomplished by:
46

 being a multiplier and growing the technical members of his team by mentoring and unblocking them. This will require getting an understanding of team member's interests and areas for improvements
understanding team dynamics and resolving conflicts
optimising development processes and the way we deliver customer value often
Where does the tech lead role sit?
More on the distinction between tech lead, team lead and dev/engineering manager: https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition- of-a-tech-lead/
Sphere of influence & Line of sight
This section is best explained as part of the Developer Role Playbook.
What to expect in the job
More accountability – You are accountable for the quality of what the team delivers and if the team delivers in the first place. There is no blaming or hiding behind your team members.
A lot less time to write code – You have to redefine how you bring value to the team. You have to look at how you enable others to contribute quality code that requires little rework and delivers to business needs rather than the amount of code or features you deliver. You now add more value to the team by becoming a multiplier rather than an individual contributor.
Juggling more context switches – The Tech Lead role challenges your time and task-management capabilities as more people will interrupt you for clarification, guidance, and advice. Burning issues draw you away from code-writing, so you need to beware of contributing to the critical path or holding unique knowledge from the team.
You need to let go – You cannot be everywhere at once and, as much as you want to tell people the traps to avoid, you have to accept
that sometimes people learn best by failing. Instead you ensure failure has a small impact by improving the speed of feedback loops.
People are hard – As a developer, you deal with computers for most of the time. You can act grumpily and the computer doesn’t react. You realise that everyone is unique and so reacts differently to your interactions. Suddenly you are responsible for resolving conflicts when, before, you could silently slip away.
 47

 It's a difficult role – It is not a job for everyone. Even if it is for you, do not expect to master the role any time soon and to make a lot of mistakes along the way. It will take years before you will be confident in your aptitude and there is always more to learn.
Expectations
These are some high level expectations. The full list of expected responsibilities and traits (attitude/behaviours) used to evaluate tech leads' performance can be found here:
What is expected
Lead from the back when the team has the skills to tackle a problem, lead from the front if you need to set new patterns Delegation is everything (you CAN'T nor are you expected to do it all), don't work yourself to death
Protect the team (from politics and from meetings)
Be the tie breaker/mediator in technical conversations if no consensus can be found
What is not expected Ego
Dictatorship
Strong opinions (listen/open-minded) or they should be loosely held
Being the best coder
Playing with shiny toys whilst the team is slaving away (innovation time is for everyone)
Picking up the biggest/most challenging tasks. Considering the limited coding time you have, you should consider picking the least important tasks as there is low chances you can see the big/important tasks through and will become the bottleneck.
Purpose
Build systems, not software Grow people
Expectations Responsibilities
􏰀 Delivery/Execution
Co-responsible with Product Manager Keep the team focussed and on track

Attention to detail
              FAQs
There are a lot of misunderstandings with some team members. One minute we are on the same page, the next we're not.
Use face to face rather than emails or Slack
After you've explained something, get the person to repeat/explain it in their own words to see if they have fully listened/understood ???
I seem to struggle keeping track of everything I have to do and how to prioritise my days
Checklists!
Tick items as you go Reorganise/update them daily
My ego tells me I should know everything better than anyone in my team
We've all been there, but it's a common mistake to do. It actually leads to the "New manager spiral of death" (https://medium.com/@rands/the-new-manager-death-spiral-51a806b252dd)
You don't need to be the best coder anymore, you need to have a different lens by looking at the future as well as the now and keep your team on track.
My team members are disorganised/all over the place
They need to understand the goal/priorities and why (customer value) to be able to make the right decisions ???
I have a lot of interruptions/context switching during my days
Block time off
Teach people when to leave you alone (eg. headphones? or some sign on your desk?)
50

 ???
Learn to say no/push back
Team needs realistic work to be done otherwise it is depressing/demotivating It manages people's expectations
How do I balance short term and long term tech trade offs ???
I struggle delegating/trusting my team members
You should always dive more responsibility than you think you should to team members
Unless you don't think someone can do a task, you should let them. Even if you think it won't be as good as if you were to do it. You have to let people make their own mistakes
???
What if I don't feel qualified to lead the smart people in my team?
This is called the imposter syndrome and is probably a good thing because it means you are trying to be self aware and question your ego If you are not doing a good job, you should know about it from your manager or through 360 reviews
I can't get everyone to a consensus in meetings ???
Where do I find technical help?
Dev guild Arch guild
Where do I find help in organising the work?
Scrum Master Product Owner
Where do I find help with dealing with people? Dev Manager
Other tech leads
How do I motivate people?
Know you team member interests
Caveat: Balance the delivery needs with the people interests
Give positive feedback/kudos to team members when they are doing well
51

 How to keep people on track?
Standups etc.
I struggle to find time to focus on coding
Work from home sometimes
Block time in your calendar for coding
Enter a routine eg. code reviews in the morning, mentoring, etc. Come early or leave late to benefit from the quiet hours in the office Lock yourself in a quiet room
Meeting free day
A team member doesn't raise when he is struggling
Create a trust environment
Use standups to prompt conversation about progress (make it about the task, not about the person)
Problem: What should I spend my time on? 30% coding
30% mentoring
30% business/Agile meetings
10% future thinking

 Time-Off and Vacation Policy
 Overview
This policy describes how team members should manage their absences, leaves and vacation time. This policy applies to ALL team members at Phelix. If you are unsure how the policy applies to you, please reach out to Sara for clarification.
As we’ve grown and will continue to grow into a larger team, it is important to stay organized. This policy helps us by centralising how we manage team member absences so we better manage together as a team.
Notice & Approval
Except sick days, all leave requests must be approved in advance.
Please submit your leave request in accordance with the below timelines depending on how long you will be off work :
   Length of Absence
1-2 days off
Up to 1 week off
2 weeks or more off
Advanced notice required
at least 5 days in advance at least 15 days in advance least 30 days in advance
           It is important to communicate your vacation requests to your team and to your lead as early as possible. This is especially important for popular holiday times. Communicating in advance helps your team fairly allocate coverage for your work and remain on track for client deadlines and releases.
Of course, emergencies happen and that is understandable. If you are experiencing an urgent personal situation that requires you to be absent from work, please let your lead know and submit a leave request as soon as possible.
Types of Leaves
This policy applies to all leaves, including :
National or Religious Holidays
As our team is global, please submit a request in advance if you plan on being absent during a local national holiday or religious holiday.
(except Canadian statutory holidays. If you are in Canada, please do not submit a request for statutory holidays)
Vacations Personal leaves Days off Emergency leaves
Sick Days
If you are sick and will be away for the day, please let your lead know via Slack message and drop a note in the team-availability-global channel on Slack and tag both your lead and sara@.
53

 How to submit your leave request
1. Discuss your leave with your lead if you will be away longer than 1-2 days
2. Submit a Time Off Request Form in advance
3. You will receive an approval or other response by email. Your leave is not accepted unless you receive an approval in writing. 4. Once approved, your approved leave will be reflected in the team calendar
All efforts will be made to honour time-off requests, and the more advance notice provided, the more likely your request will be approved.
Time-off requests, especially for extended time, made with insufficient notice as well as requests that conflict with the team’s critical releases or customer deadlines may be refused.

 Coding standards and guidelines
Please use SOLID principles while implementing any feature
Make sure code is robust enough to accommodate future changes
Use proper design patterns as per the need
Make sure code is backward compatible
Use proper API versioning, if you need to introduce a breaking change in any API, such as contract changes so, instead of making changes in the existing API make a new version of it (e.g., /v2/appointment)
Use industry best practices
Make sure code is reviewed properly before getting merged in develop branch
Before implementation of any new feature make a sequence diagram of it and get it reviewed by either architect or squad lead, and document it properly
Any new changes in configuration or secrets please ask DevOps to configure it in the required environment
For any new microservice DevOps will do the first deployment, please provide required configurations and secrets to DevOps for it

Note : We need to stop use of @Inject decorator instead of that use constructor for dependency injection checkout following example
Reason behind this change is that it is very difficult for now to mock @Inject decorator for unit test cases for now as we don’t have support for mocking typedi via decorator in node js

 Getting started with cloud
Phelix uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for development and production. To get started with with GCP, please request access to GCP by
contacting sreteam@phelix.ai over email, or ask in the slack channel app.slack.com/client/T5RV1RASD/C01U8B44ALF
Once you have access to GCP, you will need to install google cloud SDK in your development machine. The link to installation procedure is
here :   Install the gcloud CLI | Google Cloud
After successful installation of gcloud sdk, initialize it by runnning in your terminal:
gcloud init
This will open a browser window asking you to login with your phelix email address (which has access to GCP), allow the sdk to access the phelix account on your behalf. Afterwards, go back to the terminal where you ran gcloud init and choose blockhealth-microservice as project id.
    60

 Accessing Microservices Development k8s cluster
Phelix runs the microservices on Kubernetes. They are running in pods that are accessible only from the VPC they are in. In order to interact with the cluster, you need to use kubectl utility. If you have already installed gcloud sdk, kubectl should be available on your path. Get the necessary credentials with the following command:
:~$gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-dev-1 --zone northamerica-northeast1-a --project blockhealth- microservice
The previous command may ask you to login with your Phelix email address; allow the login to proceed and give the gcloud sdk access. If the gcloud command above successfully finishes, you will have the appropriate credentials configured with kubectl to access the cluster.
  To get a list of all microservices running inside the cluster:
 :~$kubectl get deployments
NAME
appointment-ops-service appointment-service

 How to connect to google cloud MySQL server with cloud IAM authentication
Google cloud sql proxy is a proxy that will handle proxying local sql connection from developer workstaion to cloudSQL without IP whitelisting, over TLS secured connections. Please download the appropriate version of cloudsql proxy for your operating system from here:
Releases · GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy
Copy the binary to your path so that you can start it from your command line(bash/zsh/cmd/windows terminal), please consult your operating system manual for appropriate ways to add a program to your path.
cloud_sql_proxy uses your gcloud SDK to authenticate you to cloudsql instance, so make sure you have logged into gcloud successfully with your phelix email address. You will need to do this every few days at most:
1 gcloud auth login
To verify that you have logged into gcloud with appropriate username, run the following:
The output should say something like this:
    1 curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \ 2 -d "access_token=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
3 https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo

Start cloud SQL proxy from a shell with following flags:
1 cloud_sql_proxy -instances=project-id:region:sql-instance-name=tcp:3306 For example, to connect to phelix-dev SQL instance, you will use this command line flags:
1 cloud_sql_proxy -instances=blockhealth-microservice:northamerica-northeast1:phelix-dev=tcp:3306 This will open a locally proxied sql connection to the remote cloudsql instance, available on localhost port 3306.
You can connect to it via mysql cli client. In another shell (other than the one where cloudsql proxy is running), run this command on bash/zsh:
1 MYSQL_PWD=`gcloud auth print-access-token` mysql --enable-cleartext-plugin -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 --user=username This was tested on a ubuntu 20.04 machine with bash/zsh.
On windows powershell, the mysql connection command is slightly different:
1 mysql --enable-cleartext-plugin -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 --user=username --password="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"

 Frontend Best Practices
Here are few instructions about best practice based on frontend, mostly on react & javascript standard. Follow ECMAScript 6 guideline. What is es6?
1. Use let or const instead of var
2. Use 2 spaces for file indentation. If the file is written in 3 or 4 spaces. Use same indentation for the whole file. Do not mix the indentation in one file.
Don't:
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11
{/* Sample react snippet. Using mixture indentation */} {blogPageEnabled &&
 (<div key={index}>
              <Page
                id={data.id}
                text={data.text}
                />
</div> })
}
Do:
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10
{/* Sample react snippet. Using 2 spaces of indentation */} {blogPageEnabled && (
  <div key={index}>
    <Page
      id={data.id}
      text={data.text}
    />
</div> )}
3. Preferably use .vscode configuration with standard and include it inside project. Also it should be added in git . How to add .vscode in project directory?
4. Add an newline at the end of each file.
5. Use Enums when using logics (if needed). For example, you’re writing, if someone is admin, do this, if normal user do that
Example code would be like this (Don’t):
   1
2
3
4
5 6}
// Ok code, but can be improved !!
if (user.type === "admin") { // do staff
} else if (user.type === "normal") { // do staff
Instead of, use enum (Do):
64

  - But, why we should write extra code?
- Because using enum improved the consistency of code, no spelling error would happen, more bug free code and obviously easy to use for IDE suggestions.
- When we should use enum?
- If there're a definite number of fixed/constant values for any one variable then enum should be used
P.S.: Using uppercase is not must but preferable.
6. Do not make your line longer. Preferably not more than 160 characters (every IDE has this feature).
Don’t:
1 <input onChange={onChangeHandler} value={val} type="text" placeholder="This is sample input" className="form-c Do:
7. --More will come--
   1 <input
2 onChange={onChangeHandler}
3 value={val}
4 type="text"
5 placeholder="This is sample input"
6 className="form-control no-border"
7 />

if (user.type === USER_TYPES_ENUM.ADMIN) {
  // do staff
} else if (user.type === USER_TYPES_ENUM.NORMAL) {
  // do staff
}
// clean code
const USER_TYPES_ENUM = {
  ADMIN: "admin",
  NORMAL: "normal"

 Engineering Best Practices
Development
Frontend
Access to Figma (narrowed down to specific microservice) and associated design guidelines Postman Collections (if available)
N.b., This should be mandatory in the future so that any new frontend engineer can at least get acquainted with the data model(s)
and the payload structure (both request and response)
Integration know-how of any new microservice to existing blockhealth-app
N.b., This point will be removed when the blockhealth-app becomes a full-fledged microservices-based architectural app; refer to document-training-frontend README.md
Tokens generation script for testing. But use tokens from cookies when integrated into existing app.
Use of environment variables into the blockhealth app.

 How to create a release branch or prepare your changes for release
1. Merge your code in develop branch and mention the environment variable changes in .env.template
2. Discuss upcoming release plan with squad lead and architect and mark Jira stories which need to be released and provide a version
name to release like 1.1.0
3. create a release branch from master (if microservice already exists in production) name of the release branch should contain the release
version of microservice e.g. release/1.0.0
4. if microservice is going for the first time in production then create a release branch from develop branch following the same naming
conventions as mentioned above
5. create a tag from release branch for staging environment deployment and for production deployment tag for production deployment should have suffix “-prod “ e.g. 1.1.0-prod
6. once the deployment is successful in the production and everything is up and running in production create MR to merge release branch in master branch with squash commit option (Note: don’t delete release branch ), this is not applicable for bugs, for any production fix we can create new release branch or hotfix branch from master branch (which have latest release code)
7. maintain a deployment plan document which will have the following details about microservice going into production, a. their tag number
b. description of changes,
c. contact person in case of issue while doing deployment, d. is deployment need DB script execution
e. secret or configuration changes if any
69

 Steps to build and deploy a new microservice manually in gke Step 1: Add .npmrc file in root folder of project and add following lines in .npmrc file
//npm.phelix.ai/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN} strict-ssl=false
always-auth=true registry=http://npm.phelix.ai
Step 2: Overwrite a Dockerfile with following lines
     1 FROM node:14-buster-slim 2
3 # Create work directory
4 WORKDIR /usr/src/app
5
6
7 ARG NPM_TOKEN 8
9 COPY .npmrc .npmrc
10 COPY package.json package.json
11 RUN npm install && npm install --global nps
12 RUN rm -f .npmrc
13
14 # Copy app source to work directory
15 COPY . /usr/src/app
16
17 # Build and run the app
18 RUN nps build
19 CMD ["nps","start"]
20
Step 3: Build and deploy microservices by using following commands build and tag the container :
docker build -t gcr.io/blockhealth-microservice/example-service:0.1 --build-arg NPM_TOKEN= "EAZGJUu2FxpNvMZlMVaAZnUMvm2zV4yS6vu0/HoFbSU=" .
deploy deployment of service:
kubectl create deployment example-service --image=gcr.io/blockhealth-microservice/example-service:0.1
Create a new secret
1 kubectl create secret generic sec-example-service --from-env-file example-service-secret.env -o yaml --dry-run= Apply the secret
1 kubectl apply -f sec-example-service.yml Create a new configmap:
1 kubectl create configmap cfg-example-service --from-env-file example-service-config.env -o yaml --dry-run=clien Apply the configmap:
         70

  1 kubectl apply -f cfg-example-service.yml

 How to dump and restore Webapp DB into GCP SQL
There will be a ‘SUPER privilege' related error if a simple dump and restore was attempted. The dump also need to skip purged GTIDs.
mysqldump --set-gtid-purged=OFF -h $HOST $DB -u $USER -p > dump.sql
sed 's/\sDEFINER=`[^`]*`@`[^`]*`//g' dump.sql > cleandump.sql
The sed command will clean all the DEFINER commands in the original dump. The cleandump can be imported in a gcloud SQL instance afterwards.
  73

 How to raise a merge request (MR)
For new feature development, create a branch from develop and keep the branch name same as your Jira ticket ID
E.g., you need to develop a feature linked with Jira ticket with id WA-123, you branch name would be WA-123
While creating a MR make sure there should not be any conflict with the target branch if it is there, resolves them before assigning a MR for review
Make sure your MR title is must consist of Jira ticket id related to the task and a brief description
E.g., WA-123: My new feature brief description,
E.g., [WA-1234, WA-1235]: a brief description of both task (if you are rasing single MR for multiple tasks)
Make sure you have ticked delete branch after merge and squash commit options while raising a MR
Assign a MR to the reviewer and get approval from it, make sure to get your changes reviewed from the maintainer of the repository

Walk-in Appointments
Slot selection (appointment slots being pulled from EMR)
Check if the appointment slots are for the right schedule code, along with the duration
Booking one appointment for the first available slot
Cycle through all slots until then EOD and review the closing message
If there are two consecutive Ws, the EMR/Oscar only presents the first one and ignores the second, and goes to the third one e.g in WWWW, only 1 and 3 are presented, in WSWW, 1 and 3 are presented, in WSWSWWW, 1 3 5 7 are presented
Check if end of the call notes are captured in EMR and Phelix
Check whether the right appointment status code (preconfigured by the clinic) shows up in the EMR Family doctor Appointments
Check if the appointment slots are for the right schedule code, along with the duration Check if existing patient has a family doctor in EMR or not
Review the message that the patient hears
Slot selection (appointment slots being pulled from EMR when family doctor found)
Booking one appointment for the first available slot
Cycle through all slots until then EOD and beyond (next day et al.)

  Patient Names not requested using Phone Number Verification Method
 When only a phone number is used as the first step of verification and a new patient account is being created, the second step does not ask for the user’s first and last name. This causes problems as the Oscar profile cannot be easily found as there is no Health card version code, and the Phelix profile is not complete due to the first take away.
 Description: Any form configuration that does not have either the first or last name enabled, there is no EMR record for the patient, EMR search is on and Enable Creating New Patient is on.
Form Set Up: only the automatic required field, phone is on, EMR search is on and Enable Creating New Patient is on.
Test Case Set Up:
  The phone number of a new patient - does not exist in Oscar or Phelix - was inputted.
The name of the patient is not part of the requested information in the next section.
  The patient information was filled in as follows.
   The patient name is not requested when using phone number verification method. This leads to errors in the new patient profile that is created.

  Patient was provided timeslots for multiple physicians.
Both options appear to provide the same information.
In addition, clicking “Show more time slots” shows a calendar view instead of what is in the functionality document for the option , “Next Available”:
When the patient clicks on “show more times”, then replace the three existing times with the next set of three times (can be for different doctors).
Customized 3 Does Not Exist in Oscar Description
This test cases has to do with the schedule template code c corresponding with the description, “Customized 3”. Unfortunately, there is no such description in Oscar so the appointment just becomes a “To Do” description.

  Appointment was chosen.
 Appointment showed up in the physician schedule.
Appointment was listed as a “To Do”.
  There does not appear to be a ”Customized 3” status option.

  Only One Physician Availability Provided In Some Circumstances
Possible issue
Circumstances
Booking availability on the current day is minimal. (Only one or two timeslots left). These test cases were reran after manual testing was completed and this issue was not present, so it appears to be a circumstantial rather than a persistent issue.
Description
When booking availability for the current day is minimal, only one physician’s availability is provided instead of two.
Screenshots
Patient was verified successfully
The appointment options only have one physician available. The appointment can be made as can be seen in the passed test cases section, it was just different so I noted it.
 113

  Availability Can Skip Open Timeslots Circumstances
Available timeslots on the current day are fully booked for Do, Kiet (17th May 2021).
Description
When attempting to book a timeslot using both the “Patient Choice” option and “Next Available” option, the timeslots provided seem to not correspond to the next opening either physician has. Although the “Patient Choice” option does not necessarily need to show the next available timeslot, as these two are currently synonymous, the issue was tested for both options. The system does not pull up the next availability for any of the physicians and sometimes skips days providing availability for two days in the future. This occurs for both S and W schedule template codes.
Screenshots Patient Choice
Patient was verified successfully.
Appointment options were provided for two physicians.
 114

  For both physicians, these timeslots did not correspond to their next availability. An example using Kiet Do is provided from the 18th of May, 2021.
Kiet Do
Next Available
Usage of the “Next Available” option did not return any different physician appointment choices.

  Patient Profile in Phelix
For all of the 5 test cases, the patient profiles were not completed in Phelix. As this issue has already been described in depth in Patient Verification (Smart Element) - Manual Testing , it will not be described here.Test Cases - Walk-in Booking
Notes
It was presumed that a patient record in Oscar was synonymous with having a patient record in Phelix as the functionality of reading patient records was not what was being tested in this manual test.

 Takeaways of current findings:
General Concerns for all Test Cases
When medication information is not asked for, Oscar will just create and fill in the information, e.g. duration, repeats, prescription date. For prescription date, it will use the current date.
Within the functionality sheet, side effects is included, but not seen during testing.
Some input fields are missing from the form preview for frequency of medication use. For example, when choosing specific days, there is no menu for how many times a day.

Notes:
Having a patient record in Phelix was decided to be synonymous with having a patient record in Oscar and thus this section was removed.
The allergies option of the medication list has been added for the testing on 17th of May 2021. All previous testing has been presumed to be completed without allergy option turned on.

Notes:
Ian ask what the effect of appointment status is.
Ian ask what integrated check in is.
As picking different consent options did not seem to register with the form, on the 18th of May 2021, after test cases 1a-4h, test cases based on differences in consent response were omitted from this round of testing. They will be completed next round of testing.
As ability of system to book different appointment statuses was not the purpose of this manual testing, only one test case was completed for each appointment status. In the next round of testing, after receiving guidance from Mayank, more extensive testing RE: Appointment status can be completed.

 How to feed test results/observations into the system
Some key points related to testing
1. Anybody can test anything. This is better for the organisation. 2. Testing can be:
a. Ad-hoc: Test any I/O at any point in time
b. Procedural: Either write tests, then code; or code, then write tests.
c. Phased: Akin to waterfall model, wherein you develop the entire feature, and then have a dedicated phase to do the tests
3. It is never to de-mean anybody. It is simply to weed out bugs that might ultimately hamper the end user (In the case of Phelix, this is very important since Phelix is in the healthcare domain)
What to report?
Bug: An unexpected/wrong behaviour. May be flaky. It is something that should not happen in the first place
Enhancement: This is something which makes an existing feature better to work with. Enhancements are not bugs. Not all enhancements can be directly incorporated. They mostly require business analysis before being implemented.
Guidelines
As a developer fraternity, it is often times required of an individual developer to contribute to the testing phase irrespective of that developer being a dedicated tester. Since each developer has a unique style of reporting, it is imperative to establish a standard procedure so that the reports can be consumed and worked upon effectively.
Jira is the only place to report bugs and take actionable measure(s). Confluence is the place to collect all the issues before putting them up in Jira.
In Confluence:
a. Provide initial environment for the target developer(s) to setup/or prepare the system (ref. Table 1)
b. State issues in a tabular format (ref. Table 2)

Environment Target app Documentation Anything else

 Few of my concerns to be discussed, as I’ve voiced over the past few weeks:
lacking concept of re-usable elements. Many elements (even well designed ones), exist in many shapes and forms in different places. (Example date / year picker for meds/clinical histories/procedures). This drives me crazy, as it just makes more work for everyone. Even for hard coded elements — we have different versions of the same ones (eg medications and past procedures / surgeries) that were built without concept of reusability
lacking scalability in terms of common functions of ALL elements — things like mandatory fields and printing to PDF should NOT be done element by element — and taking weeks / months to do so. It should be common to all existing and new elements. We should also be able to print to xml format
Logic elements severely lacking and implemented without any foresight (ie not being able to add multiple elements after a logic statement or dragging and dropping ANY element in any logic statement
Improper naming or use of elements
Some elements have their own next buttons, some don’t — often leading to double buttons at the bottom or steps
... and many other smaller issues

Akumin Testing Notes Mar 17, 2023 Status explanation:
Test and See- leave it for now
Add to UAt/Prod should be there
Add to - need to groom
Video link:   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KMW-D6y-z6VqhffvVgVWmxqhmG0n9Wlh/view RESTRICTED CONTENT
1. Color code availability onto schedule (add to phase 9 - high priority)
a. Video time: 04:00 if you go to schedule setting, you see colors, Day list - user should see light version of same colors - So when user
should be booking an appointment, he should see blocks and book it.
2. Check double booking flow (test and see)
3. Downtime (print schedules, upload manual registration) (wait for now)
4. Tech wordlist not saving details (already in UAT/prod stability - critical)
5. Payment form —>Video time: 04:38 not showing itemized (add to UAT/prod stability - high)
a. Payment form was not showing itemized details i.e. which procedures i am paying for. It shows empty in line details which should not
be the case - prod stability. its a bug- no design required.
6. Decouple payment from registration — special case for ppl to skip payment and discuss in person (wait for now)
7. Detailed review of pending dictation and report sent flows (test and see)
8. VWR orders not correct (already in UAT/prod stability)
9. VWR —>Video time: 05:15 you’re up next for modality (add to phase 9 - medium)
a. This is in virtual waiting room, currently we can only configure message and cadence for all the locations and room levels, need a way to configure different waiting room configurations for each room. Designs required
10. Tech worklist not ordered Video time: 06:25 (add to UAT/prod stability)
a. As per discussion , default for every worklist, should be group by priority first and within priority oldest on top. -No design required
11. Updating orders without exact procedure Video time: 07:38 (add to phase 9 - high) right now if we are adding referrals, it asks to add procedures and it makes one add code and description. But often staff doesn’t know what the procedure is and same with patient. If order comes in inbox sometimes theere is no clear info. In the inbox and sself referral form there should be an option of adding modality field. Either modality or procedure
a. Updates to procedure directory (group by modality if not already) - Ahsan from core workflow team. I should know which locations have MRI.
5
          360

 b. Updates to inbox/daylist: When adding referral/appt, need ability to just select modality, when procedure is not known. Modality should then filter down location. Procedure needed for non manual booking
c. Updates to self referral form
12. Option to skip send missing items —>Video time: 11:00 (Discuss latest designs with Rishabh) Phase 9 and priority ???
a. As logn as I have fax no entered in Fax field then Request missing item button should become alive
b. We need to be able to request missing items before going to end
c. once i go to end,and i adding referral, i should have option to disable message going out.
d. We can de-couple request missing items and create incomplete
e. For now, just remove the delivery preference from here. also remove notes to referral provider, and then add referral is my only way to add referral, IF i get a flag it means complete. there should not be 2 buttons for add referral.
f. Add referral gets incomplete items flag then we can add incomplete items from there.
g. Delivery Preferences should be renamed to----> Fax Notification - Under it there will be Automated notifications toggle with On/OFF switch. Request missing items only happens if user intentionally click it.
13. Insurance incomplete —> updating in reasons? (Test and see)
14. Eligibility failed —> add true, and check off worklist (assign as critical phase 9 task) video time: 20:00 → small fix to help testing/early implementation. Assign to Avinash to do for Wed.
a. They don't trust insurance.
b. All complete referrals, whether eligibility verified or failed - should be in the Eligbility Failed worklist. We can rename Eligibility failed
to Eligibility Review.
c. Rish will add a icon so user can mark it as cleared from the list.
15. Slot being surfaced should not be shown elsewhere (real time block) (wait for now)
16. Restrict blocks by tech availability (Discuss requirements) video time: 22:10 Phase 9 and priority ???
a. Schedule Settings: Assign a physican to a block (right now procedures in the block and blocks on schedule)
b. Add a technologist in the block (currently there are Physicians and Payer)
c. When adding blocks on the schedule, If a same technologist has to serve in 2 blocks at the same time he should not be double
booked.
d. It has implications on schedule settings and Slot selection api .

 Monday <20/03/2023> Notes:
Developer need to share Daily updates and Next Day plan in Slack channel before leaving Merge UATI1 and Prod issues together (https://phelix.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10232) There should one board for prod and UAT- each ticket should be tagged UATi or Prod or both. Then comes Akumin Phase 09.
Goal is to complete anything that is not of low priority . At the end of week we will have only one board that is Phase 09.

       @Vishal Narang
1. Completed PHPROD-632 Appointment Service on Production Liquibase Migration Issue ( PHPROD-632: Appointment Servic
e on Production Liquibase Migration Issue
IN REVIEW ) (Raised MR for it)
2. Completed Fax Search with HCN( PHPR OJ-2298: Fax Search with HCN IN PROD )
(Raised MR for it)
3. Gone through velox integration documentation and added comment in ticket from the analysis, please check them. PH
PROD-687: New EMR | Velox Integration
IN PROD (Can start this tomorrow, if there is no other priority)
4. Checked issue, Did not found any issue
      Priorities of current Week: Mar 20, 2023 to Mar 24, 2023
Patient Search - Search is working in all cases, Physican search is alos part of it
Making sure , there is no duplicate in the EMR
Document is always uploaded These should be part of 1.5 release
Vishal - first finish the prod issues, and after the migration stuff, he can start on Velox. Fax Inbox Testing Meeting Notes Mar 21, 2023
Canadian Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Center
1. Left menu bar, need to switch to new one- order of items
2. Patient duplicate not created - worked good.
3. Upload Fax, Processing of documents is taking too long (More than 5 minnutes). - Need to check issue with multiple processing of documents
4. Patient found - Multiple matches found (in listing) and then showed only single one- I think when creating new referral, it is searching again. Search logic should be the same as of Old Inbox - It should search HCN Only - S
5. Search on HCN is not enabled on this account. it should be on all Canadian accounts. Robert to pass list of canadian accounts to Aditya.
 6. Search should not only taking the name, it should include everything to match-
7. We are having issues with search - we are creating duplicate patients in EMR-
Inbox Testing feedback Mar 22, 2023
1. Left menu bar, need to switch to new one- order of items
2. Step 2- First name mis match error - where as first name is correct. 3. Name search changes are not done yet.
4. Search Physician - @Ahsan Habib will look into this.
a. Finish auto search on name
b. Physician - CPSO is here and billing no is missing.- Billing - Billing /NPI mismatch - @Nurbek Izbassar c. Note - NPI is only for US and Billing for Canada. for the Canadian one need to check billing field.
to check that,
     5. PHProj-2305 - Referral checklist- Why it only have patients. they should have - @Nurbek Izbassar @Aditya Pancholi a. patient
 b. referral providers, - what field is this? @Kashif Shahzad (Unlicensed) -
  5
386

  c. and reason - is this procedures? @Kashif Shahzad (Unlicensed) Please find below screenshot. This point is related to this step: @Aditya Pancholi Could you please update @Nurbek Izbassar regarding field info?
6. Edit referral -Referral documents not pushed - @Aditya Pancholi to check.
7. 2 documents of same date March 22, - one fail and other passed front end issue @Nurbek Izbassar @Neelam Panchal need to
check this. Document overridden issue.
a. Document should be working fine, just in case of duplicate they willl fail.
8. Patient Match found issue- what is the issue? @Kashif Shahzad (Unlicensed)
        387

  9. Step 1 - Search Patient - it should take the whole payload rather than only considering patient name.
10. Step1 - Bug in the update- passing the HCN and its not update in EMR.
11. Step 2- Ahsan to check Dr. Greogry young - Update address -
a. For Billing No starting zero should not be dropped - its 6 digit no and first can be zero.
Highlighted Priorities for @Ahsan Habib
1. Complete auto search based on physician name / city / location (ticket already exists for this) 2. Make sure update in directory / add location is working (ticket already exists for this)
3. Make sure billing numbers can be handled with '0' in front (must be 6 digits) - PHProj-2303 4. Make sure FE is using billing number (not CPSO number) - PHProj -2304

            PRODUCTI ON
   Execute the api to update checkpoint webPhysicianIds setting to mxPhysicianIds before triggering any checkpoint as we are checking MxProviderId while updating validating the physicians.
So
MxProviderId is incoming from appointment Event
And already created checkpoint settings should be updated from WebPhysicianId → MxPhysicianId

  #2 and #3 are working fine. tested properly
#1 is test on OSCAR but as we don’t have Accuro UAT instance active - We were unable to test this there. But as this change is not EMR specific, we are expecting to work for all EMR in same way. We can test on Prod after deployment.

 New fax inbox - merge from develop to UAT2
Implement pagination for list of data like patient timeline , appointment and messages - for now we are just considering appointment list
infinite scrolling in patient to support archived data display also
We need to add indexing in all the required tables
From archiving perspective we need to remove data from those tables which are being consumed from BE only - like Job schedule table and appointment ops table

The documentai needs access to form recognizer. The form recognizer URL will need to be updated in the documentai orchestration
Documentai is currently using secret to access gcp cloud storage. This might need to be updated for production
The location of the marfiles for all model services is located at gcp bucket
gs://documentai_models/mo dels . The model services will need to be given permission to
access this bucket.
The OCR containers were located outside the DEV

 x.x.x - Updates
Implement pagination for list of data like patient timeline , appointment and messages - for now we are just considering appointment list infinite scrolling in patient to support archived data display also We need to add indexing in all the required tables
From archiving perspective we need to remove data from those tables which are being consumed from BE only - like Job schedule table and appointment ops table

 Backlog
Add chatbot/webform to the web app to receive support requests Workplace productivity - extend worklists one step further
Captured from #industrynews
We should extend our worklists one step further - flags / notifications after enough time has elapsed for patients that require follow up, etc. I just mean extend notifications not just for patient calls / confirmations / etc but like “patient called 3 days ago you haven’t followed up with them”

Step 2
Are regions only Ontario and BC?
Can more than one location be added for an account?
Not right now
Need to allow multiple locations per account

 Patient Journey Automation
1 Problem description
Most other tools provide very limited and rigid automation around appointments and journeys Clinics has limited use for these tools because of lack of functionality
Clinics are forced to use manual efforts to supplement the limited automated tools
2 Proposed value
It allows clinics to use zero code workflow builders to create and customize journeys across channels like SMS, Email, Phone, Fax
using checkpoints targeted and patient and physician engagement
3 Proposed solution
Phelix is developing a zero code and fully configurable patient journey builder that allows clinics to configure and automate specific journeys and mini digital experiences for common conditions or cohort groups, helping to proactively deliver care. Clinics can select from existing templates or configure their own time or event based checkpoints, configure their own EMR inclusion/exclusion logic and rules, customize their messages and response flows across all channels, and embed notifications with fully customizable, temporary, and secure web links that let you build your own mini digital health experiences (like Shopify for healthcare), including identity verification, screenings, self check- in, appointment booking, viewing test results, sharing records, digital payments, and more, all without downloading an app
4 Alternative solutions
Manually via phone
EMR-integrated patient engagement app
mobile-app focused (for patients) limited engagement via app not as customizable
simple functionality

Let’s assume a form has 3 sections:
- Section A
- Section B
- Section C
In this section patients will be asked one or multiple questions, but only same options will be showed (currently “Yes“, “No”, “Maybe”)
According to patient’s response, he/she will be redirect to another sections or another element of another section. Logic can be set like this:
if the response is YES/NO/MAYBE of ANY/ALL questions, then jump to selected section of selected elements Otherwise jump to selected section of selected elements
Also, in addition along with section/element jump, custom flags or screen can be set up.
Section/Element: jump to specific section or element according to response. Custom flag: Set a value into database according to response
Screen: Show a customized screen according to response.
All configurations should be set before save. (After this element setup, sudden section configuring might break the whole app during response)
Next step button is customized with this element.
2. Radio button
This element is almost same as the previous. Differences with the previous element are:
Options/Response value can be changed.
Logic will be set by the response of each question. eg: if response of this question is that, then go there.

Each clinic should be able to set their own checkpoints In Auth MX (handling auth, issuing tokens) - Syed
Backend
updated to include refresh token (in case it gets expired) every 15 mins need to add a DB which saves the token for each clinic
Frontend
at the time of login, auth mx will be called and stored in local, which expires in 15mins every time we encounter 401, frontend pulls/refreshes a new token

 Virtual Agent
1 Problem description
1. The clinics do not have the ability to setup virtual agents e.g. currently their IVRs are manually configured by the dev team
2. The virtual agents are limited to Phone IVRs right now, and important channels like SMS and Web Chatbots are missing
2 Proposed value
1. Introducing new channels for virtual agents and automating the current channels would allow the clinics to cater to more patients
2. The virtual agents will also enable clinics to automate certain types of communication where a warm body is not required
3 Proposed solution
Give users the ability to create virtual agents which can be run on Phone (IVR), SMS and Website (Chatbot) Designs -   Phelix.AI
4 Scope
Navigation - Main Menu > Manage (Control Panel) > Virtual Agent (new menu option)
Improve general layout of the Virtual Agent tab in the Control Panel
Clean up the menu
Three tabs - Phone, SMS, Chatbot
Once card populated per account (based on the type of account - primary, speciality, or COVID screener) User is able to buy a number for Phone/SMS (via Telnyx integration)
Clicks on Purchase Number Searches for numbers
Search results show up, or No number is found
Search again Chooses a number
User is able to assign the number for Phone/SMS Clicks on ‘No number assigned’
Number gets assigned to that flow
Website Chatbot Workflow Builder
3 types of steps Input step
Welcome message
Move the Input Message from the Paths to the Welcome message Add data element
Data pulled from the clinic table in the database e.g. clinic name, location etc.

 Flow Builder
Navigation
Control Panel > Virtual Agent > Flow Builder
Background
The Flow Builder will allows the clinics to setup their own workflows for Phone IVRs, SMS and Website Chatbot. The flow builder can have three types of steps:
Input - contains qualifying questions for the patient to enter the flow, there can be multiple input steps; consists of a statement and response elements
Verify - used to identify the patient or the physician who is calling
Action - each flow will have multiple actions depending on what the patient wants to do; the input from the user will help determine the actions
Each step can have three types of elements:
Data - populates data from the database e.g. clinic name, clinic location, patient name etc.
Response - determines what path the patient needs to follow e.g. what happens when patient presses 1, or 2 etc. AI - doesn’t impact the patient, but allows Phelix to collect data from the flow (activates listening)
Note - to see the Data and Response elements in action, try editing a SMS template in the Checkpoint Builder

ex use case : patient calls in, wants status update on referral order (all automated in Phelix) Contactcenter IVR Studio
4g style dev environment
identify a point of contact (dial#, email, anything) that is receiving an interaction --- you can then route that interaction (typically routed to an agent)
or can build call deflection workflow
can drop in our own java script
need to know how to edit IVR studio to inject our code
and need to know the bound of what we can write in our code

 Phone (Incoming)
Requirements
The first item will be the incoming phone setup using freepbx, for both IVR and real time TTS streaming for conversational AI and automated deployments via the Telnyx SIP Trunk
Acc to Mahfuz, incoming phone setup using freepbx is already done?
new short-term solution
Keep flows on PHP and run on it’s own container (instead of the Web App)
Aditya and Tutul will work on it as soon as the current migration and deployment is done
Backend work is creating webhooks for the VA - Flow Builder, Mike has mapped out what’s required, need a BE engg. to work on it Reliability, scalability and dimensioning - Mahfuz knows what to do here
setup weekly meeting with Mahfuz (and Mike, Hassaan, Tutul) and kick-off the project
Phelix uses two SIP providers
Twilio Telnyx
Old projects
1. We developed two Cloud PBX in Google Cloud, setup trunking with Telnyx, using which a user is able to make and receive calls
2. Using Telnyx SDK API, we developed webhook application to send Fax and SMS
current solution
currently we’re using Telnxy webhooks running on PHP servers
long-term solution
end goal is to use our own webhooks running on Telecom MX
short-term solution
use Telnyx webhooks on Telecom MX, and Twilio for Conversational MX based on the load we get, we can determine scalability for long-term solution
new short-term solution
Keep flows on PHP and run on it’s own container (instead of the Web App) Aditya will work on it as soon as the current migration and deployment is done
Note from Hassaan:
The first item will be the incoming phone setup using freepbx, for both IVR and real time TTS streaming for conversational AI and automated deployments via the Telnyx SIP Trunk
Acc to Mahfuz, incoming phone setup using freepbx is already done?
Example
PBX system at home
every room has a desk phone with an extension
776

 Legacy system was manual switch-based (remember switchboards?)
Modern systems turn any server to a telephonic switch
In cloud if you have a Linux node, you can deploy your own PBX on top of Linux
If one user is registered on that server with a user id, they can directly call another registered user using digital credentials (virtual DID)
In an advanced setup, our PBX system can be used to call phone lines from third-party providers
This uses SIP trunking provide by Twilio and Telnyx (also in Canada), need to use Telnyx for Canadian clinics due to data privacy
Telnyx is the bridge between our Cloud PBX and the Telecom providers
Our own PBX is needed to provide Phelix users dedicated (virtual) phone numbers for IVR and SMS, called DIDs, and these DIDs are then mapped in Telnyx to communicate with Telecom providers (and used like normal SIM)
Using Cloud PBX we can prepare a programmable IVR menu, can also be used for Fax and SMS
If we plan to replace Telnyx, only config in our Cloud PBX needs to change, there won’t be any redeployment
Meeting Notes
  Date
  8th Apr 2021
   Move current PHP Telnyx IVRs which are on WebApp to its own service/server Create Flow Builder
Phone
Should be able to work with IVR hooks (like we are doing now with Telnyx)
scalability is important
two instance running on Asterix
if can’t handle load, scale vertically
Should be able to work with Conversational AI (layer in STT)
Use STT package of Asterisk to convert speech to text
Endpoint built in Python which consume this text Website Chatbot
Use AGI/ARI for NodeJS
Use APIs to Purchase Phone Numbers Need two MX
Telecom MX (existing) - interacting with Telnyx, Asterix
Conversation MX (new) - Handle all interactions with phone, chatbot and other channels (omni channel)
Mahfuz
DTMF input forward to MX endpoints
Setup phone number in Asterix, when DTMF values are entered, hit MX API endpoints Setup STT package in Asterix, FreePBX
Sadique Telecom MX
Use AGI/ARI APIs (NodeJS) to create integration with Asterix
Build Telecom MX API endpoints which will receive DTMF values/input Flow Builder MX
Orchestrates the path after receiving data from Telecom MXP; pass these values and IVR inputs to Conversation MX, process details, and send back to Telecom MX for IVR outputs
Handles interactions with other MX e.g. Patient, Appointment User service mesh for synchronous comm b/w MXs
Mayank
Help Sadique architect Telecom and Flow Builder MX
  16th April 2021
    Sadique needs keys for Telecom MX Mahfuz needs details on Google STT
Using STT in the app right now, need to discuss with Mike Sadique suggested looking into MRCP (unimrcp.org)
Google Speech Recognition plug-in
Sadique suggested looking into cephei’s Unimrcp plugin
Sadique can add TTS (XML support) to AGI to keep everything in one place so we can use TTS in the flow builder

 Consent Flow
 Consent Flow:
At first point of contact, a carefully worded consent SMS will be sent. This consent SMS will contain text alerting the patient that if they want to withdrawal consent they can reply “STOP”. Once the SMS is sent, the word “STOP” sent at anytime thereafter, (n SMS later), will trigger a toggle in the patient MX noting that the patient does not want to be contacted. Before the checkpoint MX triggers any checkpoints, it will always check to ensure that the consent toggles in the patient MX have not been triggered. If they have, no SMS can be sent to that patient.
Configuration of Consent Checkpoint:
Clinic will automatically have a checkpoint set up that is “On” by default. If the clinic wants to change the wording of the SMS or toggle the checkpoint off, they will be provided a disclaimer removing liability from Phelix.
813

 Logic For Sending Consent Checkpoint:
IF consent has not been sent to a phone number AND patient has not been sent consent THEN consent will be sent. ELSE, consent will not be sent.

 Accuro API Documentation
Overview
Accuro API is the interface into the Accuro application. The core functionality includes:
Searching for and creating patients
Retrieving appointments and provider schedules
Adding patient lab results and observations
Retrieving documentation generated from a patient’s chart by an Accuro user Uploading documents to a patient’s chart Creating encounter notes within a patient’s chart
Architecture
Accuro API Architecture
Accuro API provides access to the data of many Accuro clinics. To enable this, Accuro API requires some information to determine which Accuro the application is trying to access. This required information is a uuid and a tenant, which are unique to each Accuro. Although both things represent the same thing, the tenant value is short and usually human-readable.
An application using the Accuro API is provided with a single OAuth client. Access to individual Accuro instances is governed by authenticating with each Accuro instance.
We’ll discuss authentication in more detail but Accuro users are given the tenant value of their Accuro and use that when granting access to an integrating application.
The uuid will be given and communicated to integrating applications for each Accuro they are authorized to access. For every request to the Accuro API, the uuid MUST be provided as a query parameter like:
GET /resource?uuid={uuid of Accuro instance}
 820

 Base URLs
On receiving access to the Accuro API, you will receive the base URLs for the sandbox environment where you’ll be able to develop and test your application against test data.
Once you are at the stage of connecting to a clinic’s Accuro, you will receive a production OAuth client and the base URL for the production instance of Accuro API.
Next
Discussing how to authenticate with the Accuro API will make the uuid and tenant values more clear.
Authentication
Accuro API supports user-based and machine-based authorization using OAuth 2.0 flows. For user- based authorization, a user may be either a Provider or a Patient. Machine-based authorization, or authorization that does not require any user interaction, is possible with the client credentials grant.
The majority of endpoints are only accessible with provider user-based authorization and requires your application to use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow.
Provider Authorization
Authenticating to the Accuro API involves:
1. Receiving an OAuth client for the Accuro API (each application has a single OAuth client)
2. Creating a user in the clinic’s Accuro and passing those credentials and the tenant value of
their Accuro instance to the appropriate member of the clinic
3. Your application receives the uuid for the Accuro instance
4. An Accuro user launches an OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
5. An Accuro user enters in credentials of the Service User which represents your application
6. Your application retrieves an access token and continually refreshes that token for indefinite
access
The Service User and Accuro Tenant value
In order to authenticate and access a specific Accuro instance, a user within Accuro needs to be created for your application. QHR handles the creation of this service user and gives the appropriate member of the clinic the credentials.
A member of the clinic receives the following information from QHR that is required to grant a token:
the username and password of the service user the tenant value of their Accuro instance
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant
Accuro API supports the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant and requires Accuro users to enter the service user credentials they receive from QHR. It’s highly recommended that applications use a library that implements the standard OAuth 2.0 flows. For example purposes, the actual requests are described below.
URL to initiate authorization code grant flow
{Accuro API base url}/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client ID}&redirect_uri={URI registered with your OAuth client}&scope={space-separated list of scopes}`
Accuro users are redirected to the Accuro API login screen where they enter the service user credentials. !(accapi-login.png)
821

 After an Accuro user successfully authenticates, the browser redirects to:
{Redirect URI}?code={authorization code}
Your application should retrieve the code value and use this to retrieve an access token. The code
can only be used once and has a short (10 minutes) lifetime.
POST {Accuro API base url}/oauth/token?grant_type=authorization_code&code= {code}&redirect_uri={Redirect URI}
Headers:
Authorization: basic {base64 encoded "clientId:clientSecret"}
{
"access_token": "3efc5dd9-7e29-4dcd-9b93-a1b2c3d4e6f7", "token_type": "bearer", "refresh_token": "8f81c010-1771-43f1-8188-a1b2c3d4e6f7", "expires_in": 35159, "scope": "{requested scopes}"
}
Authenticating as a Provider gives your application access to all endpoints listed here.
Refreshing your access token
To maintain access to the clinic’s Accuro, you have to continually refresh your access token with the refresh token. Access tokens have an expiry of 10 hours and a refresh token has an expiry of 30 days. The expires_in field indicates (in seconds) how long the access token is valid for from now.
You are only able to use a refresh token once. Refreshing a token will return a new valid access token as well as a new refresh token to use for the next refresh.
POST {Accuro API base url}/oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token= {refresh token}
{
"access_token": {new access token}, "token_type": "bearer", "refresh_token": {new refresh token}, "expires_in": 35159, "scope": "{requested scopes}"
}
Provider Permissions
Provider Permissions set for the Service User impacts what data will client applications will be allowed to access through Accuro API.
When authenticating to Accuro API through this mechanism, Provider-based authentication, client applications must be aware of how their requests are impacted by Provider Permissions. For more information on how Accuro API enforces Provider Permissions, go (here) [/guides/accuro- api/provider-permissions].
Machine-based Authorization with Client Credentials Grant
Accuro API supports obtaining an access token via an OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant. To obtain an access token, make a request like:
POST {Accuro API base url}/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scope= {space-seperated list of scopes} Headers:
Authorization: basic {base64 encoded "clientId:clientSecret"}
{
"access_token": "3efc5dd9-7e29-4dcd-9b93-a1b2c3d4e6f7", "token_type": "bearer", "refresh_token": "8f81c010-1771-43f1-8188-a1b2c3d4e6f7", "expires_in": 35159, "scope": "{requested scopes}"
}
822

 This access token is only able to access the public endpoints which are endpoints that do not have /patient-portal, /materials, or /provider- portal prefixes. See full API Reference.
Patient Authorization
Patient resources are prefixed with /patient-portal and provide access to patient documents, labs, and appointments as well as the public endpoints. If you need this level of access, ask your contact at QHR.
Making requests to the Accuro API
Accuro UUID
When creating the service user QHR also provides the uuid of the clinic’s Accuro to the user. It’s highly recommended that your application provide a way for users to associate their account or clinic with the uuid of their Accuro; the uuid is required to be passed as a query parameter on every request to the Accuro API.
The uuid of an Accuro instance is available in Accuro in Accuro Start Menu > Search ‘View Log’ > System Information.txt > Database UUID Including the Access Token
You need to include the access token and uuid for the clinic’s Accuro in each request to the API like so:
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/resource?uuid={Accuro uuid} Authorization: bearer {access token}
Finding and Creating Patients in Accuro
A typical workflow is for applications to search for a patient and if no patient exists, create that patient. Accuro API provides patient search and creation, enabling patient check-ins, referrals, updating existing patient information and other use cases.
Searching by personal health card number
You can search for a patient by health card number using the search endpoint.
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/provider-portal/patients/search?uuid={Accuro uuid}&phn={health card number} Patient with minimum required fields
[
{
... patient ...
}, {
... patient2 ...
} ];

Available Slots for New Appointments
The scheduling functionality in the Accuro API exposes booked appointments and can be used to determine at what times the provider is available for new appointments. Other resources include appointment types and reasons, suggestion types, appointment statuses and billing details.
This guide will introduce the concepts that are required to enable online booking functionality. The Suggestion Concept
A core concept to Accuro’s schedule is the Suggestion resource. Accuro users create suggestions that are associated with an appointment type and reason. They can then apply the suggestion which adds the suggestion to a specific provider, date, time. Key fields in the suggestion resource are:
name a unique text identifier for the suggestion. The name field is used to link a suggestion and an applied suggestion (an instance of a suggestion that exists on a provider’s schedule and has a start and end time)
appointment type ID indicating the type of appointment allowed to be booked appointment reason ID indication the reason for the appointment being booked
allowed to book boolean controlling if any appointment can be booked
Suggestions are configured within Accuro and can be added or ‘applied’ to a providers schedules at
specific times.
Example Suggestion
{
"name" : "General Checkups", "color" : {
"blue" : 12345,
"green" : 12345, "transparency" : 12345, "RGB" : 12345, "red" : 12345, "colorSpace" : {
"CS_sRGB" : true, "numComponents" : 12345, "type" : 12345 },
"alpha" : 12345 },
"abbreviation" : "CH",
"typeId" : 1,
"reasonId" : 2, "allowProviderCreation" : true, "allowMedeoEBookingRequests" : true, "barDisplay" : true,
"active" : true }
API Reference
Applied Suggestions
When suggestions are associated with a specific provider, date, and time an applied suggestion instance is created. Applied suggestions indicate when the provider can see patients and for which appointment type.
To retrieve more details (appointment type and reason) about an applied suggestion you must use the name field to find the associated suggestion. The name field links a suggestion with an applied suggestion.
Example Applied Suggestion
{
"name" : "Checkup", "providerId" : 1, "resourceId" : 1,
826

 "subColumn" : 0,
"date" : "2018-08-07T00:00:00.000-0700", "startTime" : 800,
"endTime" : 815,
"grouped" : true, "allowMedeoEBookingRequests" : true, "allowProviderCreation" : true
}
API Reference
Example of Providers Schedule
A typical schedule for a provider looks like the following diagram. All times they are available for an appointment is marked with a suggestion (called an applied suggestion) which indicates the appointment type and reason of the appointment the provider is available for.
Example Schedule
Calculating Available Slots for Appointments
A providers schedule can be thought of as a series of layers. The first layer is simply time, then applied suggestions, then appointments.
To determine the available slots for new appointments, applications need to retrieve the applied suggestions to discover the possible times a provider is available for a specific appointment type. Out of those possible times, if there is an appointment that has been booked that time should be removed as an available slot for a new appointment.
Appointment Slots
List Applied Suggestions API Reference List Appointments API Reference Gotcha: Appointment Duration
In the above example schedule, appointments actually have a duration of 30 minutes even though the applied suggestions span longer than 30 minutes. This means that multiple appointments can be booked on top of an applied suggestion if the applied suggestion is longer than 30 minutes (specifically a multiple of 30 minutes).
However, Appointment types, Suggestions, and Applied Suggestions do not have any preset duration and this data will not come back in any response objects. Applications using the Accuro API will need to provide a way for users to map a Suggestion to a specific duration.
Once the duration of appointments is known for a specific suggestion, applications are able to calculate the available slots. For example, if an applied suggestion occurs on a providers schedule from 10:00 to 11:30, and the suggestion is mapped to a 30 minute appointment duration, then there will be 3 avaibable slots for new appointments at 10:00, 10:30 and 11:00.
Example Slots Next Step
Once available slots for new appointments are known, these can be shown to users and selected by them to create a new appointment. See Creating an Appointment for how the Accuro API can be used to book appointments.
Creating an Appointment
After determining the available slots for new appointments, client applications have most of the information they need to create an appointment.
The information needed to create an appointment is:
{
"date" : "2019-01-31", "startTime" : 1300, "endTime" : 1315, "subColumn" : 1, "patientId" : 2, "providerId" : 3, "resourceId" : 4, "officeId" : 5, "maskId" : 6, "appointmentDetails" : {
"billingProviderId" : 3,
"referringProviderId" : null, // Optional
"notes" : "Patient Would like to discuss flu vaccines",
"alerts" : "Patient is always late, booked an extra 10 minutes", "reasonId" : 7,
827

 "typeId" : 8,
"priorityId" : 1, "arrived" : false, "confirmed" : false, "serviceLocation" : "O"
}}
API Reference
Below is how the above information should be populated.
date, startTime, endTime
The specifics of a date and time for an appointment is determined by which available slot is chosen
during the online booking process.
patientId
To get a valid patientId, see Finding or Creating a Patient.
providerId, billingProviderId, resourceId, subColumn, typeId, reasonId From Applied Suggestion
Each available slot for a new appointment has an underlying applied suggestion which has data fields that must be transferred into the new appointment. These fields are:
providerId, billingProviderId The provider associated with the applied suggestion and available slot resourceId May exist for some Accuro instances and clinics. Corresponds to a resource like equipment
subColumn The specific column the applied suggestion is in
Example Applied Suggestion
{
"name" : "Checkup", "providerId" : 3, "resourceId" : 4, "subColumn" : 0, "date" : "2019-01-31", "startTime" : 800,
"endTime" : 1700,
"grouped" : true, "allowMedeoEBookingRequests" : true, "allowProviderCreation" : true
}
From Suggestion
To populate the typeId and reasonId fields when creating an appointment, the actual suggestion resource should be retrieved by retrieving the full list of suggestions and extracting the typeId and reasonId field from the resource that matches the name field on the applied suggestion.
Example Suggestion
{
"name" : "Checkup",
"color" : {...},
"abbreviation" : "CH",
"reasonId" : 7,
"typeId" : 8, "allowProviderCreation" : true, "allowMedeoEBookingRequests" : true, "barDisplay" : true, "active" : true
}
API Reference officeId
828

 Accuro is capable of containing multiple offices. However, since a schedule (e.g. applied suggestions) is associated with a provider and not an office in any way, you must provide a way for Accuro users to select which office to associate appointments to. Applications are able to retrieve the list of offices and should enable users to select the appropriate office.
API Reference
maskId
This field should be omitted and ignored.
priorityId
Applications are able to retrieve a list of the priorities that exist in Accuro.
API Reference
serviceLocation
The serviceLocation should default to the capital letter ‘O’ which corresponds to ‘The Provider’s Office’. Applications may enable users to configure another location to use.
Example of service locations
Service Locations
User defined fields: notes, alerts
Applications can provide text values for the notes and alerts fields either with user input or configured values. The alerts field value will be shown in a prompt when the appointment is opened within Accuro.
Adding Labs and Observations Key Concepts
Lab Test The name of a particular test which contains result types. It is a container object to indicate which type of results will be recorded. It’s possible that a single test will have multiple measurements (these different types of measurements correspond to result types in Accuro API).
Lab Result A template which can be used to create an observation to be included in a particular lab- group. Includes things like units of measurement, reference ranges, data type, description etc.
Lab Group An instance of a lab test, including a number of different types of dates, ordering physician information, review data, internal/external notes. It contains the results that are produced by the test called ‘observations’.
Observation An instance of a lab result, includes the actual result value, notes, label to be used when displaying the observation, reference range units etc.

"resultId" : <LabResult.resultId>,
"observationRange" : <LabResult.referenceRange> } ],
"metadata" : { // Metadata is optional "property1" : "...", "property2" : "..."
}}
Updating or Adding to a Lab Group
The API allows additional observations to be attached to a lab group, or for an observation to update an existing observation. For each addition or modification to a lab group and its contained data objects, a new lab group is created which references the first base lab group as show below.
Adding/Updating to a lab group Lab Recipients and Reviews
830

 The API allows for specifying which providers should review the lab group and it’s values. These reviewing providers are the recipients of the lab and a list of the provider IDs are sent in the body of a PUT /provider-portal/{patientId}/lab-groups/{lab-groupId}/recipients. The API client can also update the reviews for the particular providers using PUT /provider-portal/{patientId}/lab- groups/{lab- groupId}/reviews
Retrieve Patient Chart Items as PDF
As part of generating documentation to send to other providers (such as when referring a patient to a specialist), Accuro users are include items from a patient’s chart. These can include:
Medical history (diagnoses, medications etc.) Encounter notes Medical documents
Lab results
These items are included in a PDF document which is called a Generated Letter. At a high level, the workflow is: 1. Accuro user creates a
generated letter and attaches chart items
1. Accuro user launches CDS link to integrating application (that’s your application!)
2. Using the Accuro context (current patient and user), retrieve the list of generated letters 4. User is shown list and selects the desired generated letter
1. Application retrieves
generated letter contents as a PDF
The steps to retrieve a generated letter with the Accuro API is describe below. Listing available Generated Letters
Applications can retrieve the list of generated letter metadata. To minimize the potential of applications retrieving the wrong generated letter the list is filtered by two required filters: the patient and the user that created the letter.
The minimal request to retrieve the list of generated letters is:
GET /v1/provider-portal/generated-letters?patientId={id}&userId={id}
Using a CDS Link to get patientId and userId
A CDS Link in Accuro allows an external web page to be loaded from Accuro and provides the option to include some Accuro context as part of the URL. When patient and user context is configured in a CDS link, applications will receive the context like so:
URL Loaded: https://{url to web page or application}?userId={id}&patientId={id}
Applications can parse out the query parameters and use those values to construct the list generated letters request.
Generated Letter Metadata
Fields that are helpful for users to identify the correct generated letter are:
appointmentId if the user knows what appointment the letter is attached to
title which is a short description the user can enter into Accuro for reference later
status Generated letters with a FILE_READY status indicates that the PDF document is available and has not been processed before. Applications will be able to update this status to indicate the generated letter has been retrieved and should not be shown.
Example Generated Letter Metadata
{
"id" : 11,
"letterId" : 12, "letterVersion" : 2, "physicianId" : 11, "officeId" : 10, "userId" : 9,
831

 "targetId" : 11, "appointmentId" : 10, "patientId" : 11,
"cc" : 0, "withCoverSheet" : true, "finalized" : true, "withAttachments" : true, "queue" : true,
"status" : "FILE_READY",
"targetType" : "physician",
"title" : "A good title",
"generateTo" : "Doctor David", "generatedTime" : "2024-06-27T00:00:00.000", "username" : "Doctor David", "extension" : "pdf"
}
API Reference
Get Generated Letter PDF Content
Once a user has selected the intended generated letter applications can call:
GET /v1/provider-portal/generated-letters/{id} with the ID of the chosen generated letter Example Generated Letter Content
--uuid:2202b992-5d86-4162-acfc-52f1bd4c15bf Content-Type: application/json Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary Content-ID: <0>
{"id":11,"letterId":12,"letterVersion":2,"physicianId":11,"officeId":10,"userId": Note Title","generateTo":"Doctor David","generatedTime":"2024- 06-27T00:
--uuid:2202b992-5d86-4162-acfc-52f1bd4c15bf Content-Type: application/pdf Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary Content-ID: <1>
<PDF Binary Data>
The response is a multipart response and contains both the metadata and the PDF binary content
of the generated letter.
Applications will likely be required to manually parse out the binary content of the PDf themselves.
Tips for Parsing a Multipart Response Extract boundary value
The response will have Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary={boundary value}. Like the above example response, the boundary will be similar to: uuid:2202b992-5d86-4162-acfc- 52f1bd4c15bf.
Extracting the binary content part
Using the boundary value contained in the Content-Type header, convert the response into an ASCII encoded string. Converting to ASCII allows to easily parse out the response and also determine the exact byte position that the binary content starts at.
Once the position of the binary content is known (and it’s length):
Get the raw bytes of the response
Using the start position and length of the binary content, slice out the bytes of the PDF content from the response Use the binary content (e.g. convert to base64, pass to a renderer etc.)
Javascript snippet that parses binary content and converts to base64 response.arrayBuffer().then(ab => {
// Decode bytes to a single byte encoded format (ASCII) var text = new TextDecoder("ascii").decode(ab); // Split response into parts.
// You should use the boundary value in the Content-Type header var parts = text.split(/--uuid:.*/gi);
// ASSUMPTION for simplicity: binary content is at // position 2 of the parts array
832

 // Also have to parse out the metadata of the part var pdfString = parts[2].split("\r\n\r\n")[1].trim(); // Find the start and end byte position of the pdf string
9
0
var startByte = text.indexOf(pdfString); var endByte = startByte + pdfString.length; // Out of the original response bytes, slice only the binary PDF content
var pdfArrayBuffer = ab.slice(startByte, endByte);
// Convert bytes to base64 and print
console.log(
btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(pdfArrayBuffer)))
); });
API Reference
Updating the Generated Letter status
Applications can mark the generated letter as FILE_RETRIEVED. This allows applications to ignore
generated letters they have already processed or have been processed by another application. POST /v1/provider-portal/generated- letters/{id}/status with a body containing FILE_RETRIEVED. API Reference
Upload a Document to Patient Chart
Accuro API provides a way to upload PDF documents to a patient’s chart. Documents on a patient’s chart are placed into folders and sub- folders. These folders and sub-folders can be retrieved by applications and their ID values used to place the document in the correct location (folder and sub- folder) on a patient’s chart.
Retieving folders
To retrieve folders, applications can GET /v1/provider-portal/folders which returns a list of folders and any sub-folders contained within each folder.
Example Response
{
"id": 2,
"name": "Labs", "subFolders": [{ "id": 2,
"name" : "Reports" }, {
"id": 3,
"name": "Full Results" }]
}
API Reference
Creating folders
Applications may want to create folders that are specific to the application. This may help users identify documents that have been uploaded by your application. Accuro users always have the option to assign the document to another folder.
To create a folder POST /v1/provider-portal/folders with: { "name": "new folder", "subFolders": [
833

 {
"name": "new subfolder1"
}, {
"name": "new subfolder2" }
]
}
API Reference
Uploading the document
Now that folders and sub-folders can be retrieved, the upload document request can be built.
The upload document request accepts multipart/form-data as the content of the request. It’s recommended that applications use a library to construct the form data. The form data contains 2 fields: details and the document.
details
The details field is populated with a stringified JSON object containing metadata about the
document like filename, patient, provider etc.
{
"file_name": "test.pdf",
"folder_id": 3,
"sub_folder_id": 3, // Optional and Accuro may not have sub-folders enabled "patient_id": 3, "description": "A helpful description",
"document_date": 2019-01-31, // Date document is stamped with - Optional
defaults to current time
"received_date": 2019-02-31, // Date document was received by Accuro - Optional
defaults to current time
"date_created": 2019-03-31, // Date document was created - Optional defaults to
current time
"reviews": [ {
"physician_id": 3, // A valid provider ID. A list of providers can be retrieved via the /v1/providers endpoint
"reviewDate": 2019-01-31 // When this exists, this marks the document as 'reviewed' and will not appear in the providers inbox
}
] // Optional - if omitted document will appear as unassigned }
Example: Setting the document as ‘Unassigned’
The following details object is an example of how to make the document get marked as ‘Unassigned’ in Accuro’s Home > Document section.
{
"file_name": "test.pdf",
"folder_id": 3,
"sub_folder_id": 3,
"patient_id": 3,
"description": "A helpful description", "documentDate": 2019-01-31, "receivedDate": 2019-02-31, "dateCreated": 2019-03-31, "reviews": null
]
834

 }
Example: Sending the document to a provider to review
The following details object is an example of how to send the document for a provider to review. {
"file_name": "test.pdf",
"folder_id": 3,
"sub_folder_id": 3,
"patient_id": 3,
"description": "A helpful description", "documentDate": 2019-01-31, "receivedDate": 2019-02-31, "dateCreated": 2019-03-31,
"reviews": [ { "physician_id": 3 },
{
"physician_id": 4
}
]
}
If multiple review items are included then the document will be sent to each provider specified in the request. Example: Marking the document as ‘reviewed’
The following details object is an example of how to mark the document as ‘reviewed’. The document will not appear in the provider’s inbox.
{
"file_name": "test.pdf",
"folder_id": 3,
"sub_folder_id": 3,
"patient_id": 3,
"description": "A helpful description", "documentDate": 2019-01-31, "receivedDate": 2019-02-31, "dateCreated": 2019-03-31, "reviews": [
{
"physician_id": 3, "reviewDate": 2019-01-31
}
]
}
document
This field in the form data should contain the raw bytes of the document file that the application is uploading to the patient’s chart. API Reference
Combined Appointment, Patient, and Provider data For all appointments, Accuro API is able to provide appointment + history, patient, provider, and
office information in a single endpoint: the /v2/materials/appointments endpoint. GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v2/materials/appointments? uuid={Accuro
uuid}&startDate={start}&endDate={end}&pageSize=50&startingId=0 Other filter query parameters include:
835

 providerId Retrieve appointments for a specific provider
officeId Retrieve appointments for a specific office. Multiple offices can be provided
e.g. officeId=1234&officeId=4321
includeNullOffice Retrieves appointments not associated with any office. This can occur if importing appointments from another source
API Reference Paginated results
Results returned by the API are paginated with a default page size of 25 and a max page size of 50. You can set the page size by passing the desired size in pageSize query parameter. Each response will contain:
{ ...,
count: {the number of items included in the response. Usually is the same as the pageSize}, lastId: {the next value for the startingId query parameter},
total: {the total remaining records, including the items in the current page} }
Determining the last page of results
There are two recommended approaches for determining when all results have been received and you have the last page of data.
1. When total is less than or equal to pageSize you have received all the pages and data. 2. When you request the next page and total, count, lastId is 0.
Example of multiple results
Assuming a pageSize of 50 and a total of 120 appointments.
Request 0
To request the first page of appointment data, set ?startingId=0.
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v2/materials/appointments?uuid={Accuro uuid}&startDate={start}&endDate= {end}&pageSize=50&startingId=0
{ ...,
count: 50,
lastId: 123456789, total: 120
}
Request 1
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v2/materials/appointments?uuid={Accuro uuid}&startDate={start}&endDate= {end}&pageSize=50&startingId=123456789
{ ...,
count: 50,
lastId: 234567891, total: 70
}
Request 2
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v2/materials/appointments?uuid={Accuro uuid}&startDate={start}&endDate= {end}&pageSize=50&startingId=234567891
836

 { ...,
count: 20,
lastId: 345678912, total: 20
}
Since the total (the amount of remaining items) is 20 and pageSize is 50 then all items and pages have been retrieved. The lastId returned here can be used in another request at a later time to retrieve any new or updated appointments.
Request 3 - No more results
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v2/materials/appointments?uuid={Accuro uuid}&startDate={start}&endDate= {end}&pageSize=50&startingId=345678912
{ ...,
count: 0, lastId: 0, total: 0
}
Request 4 - After some appointments get created/updated
Updated and new appointments will be added to the end of the list. They can be retrieved by requesting the next page(s). Assuming 10 appointments were created or updated after last request.
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v2/materials/appointments?uuid={Accuro uuid}&startDate={start}&endDate= {end}&pageSize=50&startingId=345678912
{ ...,
count: 10,
lastId: 456789123, total: 10
}
Adding Encounter Notes to a Patient’s Chart
Notes (letters) contain information, such as progress notes or summaries, related to an interaction with a patient (which may be an appointment, phone call, an interaction with a clinical tool etc). Accuro API provides the ability to create notes on a patient’s chart and format this content using the Rich Text Format.
Letter/Note Types
Accuro users can create different types of letters/notes. You should retrieve the list of available types configured in Accuro and present these to the user to select the appropriate type.
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/provider-portal/letters/types?{Accuro uuid} [
{
typeId: 1,
typeName: "Clinical Note", abbreviation: "CN"
} ];
API Reference
Creating a letter/note
After selecting the specific type for the letter, you can now create the letter/note. PUT {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/provider-portal/letters
837

 Request Body
{
typeId: 1, // Required
patientId: 1, // Required
providerId: 1, // Optional
appointmentId: 1, // Optional - Used to associate this letter/note with an
appointment
title: "Summary from your Application", // Required content: "
{\\rtf1\\ansi\\n{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fnil\\Monospaced;}\\n{\\colortbl\\red0\\ \\red166\\green169\\blue0;\n\\red0\\green0\\blue170;}\\n\\b Your content here --\\~ \\n}\\n" // Required API Reference
Plain Text
For simple notes that don’t require any formatting, you are able to just provide a string to the
content field like: content: "The patient has 100% recovered!". Rich Text Format
If your application requires notes to be formatted and styled, you are able to provide a Rich Text Format file to the content field.
The RTF Pocket Guide is a good resource for understanding the basics of RTF syntax. Accuro and Accuro API do not guarantee that all syntax is supported. You should test to ensure that the RTF features you are using are supported. If things are not correctly formatted, it’s likely that the particular keyword that is not rendering correctly is not supported.
}
g
Accuro utilizes RTFEditorKit to display letters/notes which does not support all RTF features like images and tables.
Character Encoding
You should only send ASCII characters to ensure no characters become mangled.
Accuro Providers and Offices Offices Offices may represent:
distinct real-world offices that contain distinct or shared providers
various groups within a single real-world office
distinct service types or functions the clinic provides like walk-ins, online-booking, or a family doctor clinic etc. custom groupings to address organizational needs
You should provide an ability for Accuro users to specify which office(s) your application should be interested in and interact with. For example, appointments need to be associated with an office but schedule data is only associated with a provider. In order to know what office to populate when creating an appointment your application should provide a way for users to indicate which office to use.
Retrieving the list of offices
To provide a list of offices to display to users so they can indicate the appropriate office to use in
API interactions:
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/offices?uuid={Accuro uuid} [

Access to the Accuro Waitlist
The Accuro Waitlist allows clinics to track patients who require an appointment currently not available in the Accuro scheduler. When an appointment availability becomes available, clinics are able to find which patient is next in priority to be booked for an appointment at that time.
Accuro Waitlist
Accuro API enables client applications to get, create, and update consult waitlist booking requests.
Searching Waitlist Requests
You are able to search and retrieve waitlist requests through the following endpoint and the results can be optionally filtered by a specific waitlist provider, patient or waitlist consult status.
GET {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/provider-portal/waitlists? waitlistProviderId=1&patientId=1&consultStatus=Booked&startingId=0&pageSize=50
{ "contents": [
{

} ],
"count": 1, "total": 1, "lastId": 1000
}
Pagination
Results returned are paginated. The maximum pageSize is 50 with a default value of 25 if no pageSize parameter is provided. To request the next page, you need to set the startingId parameter to the value of lastId received in the previous request.
The total field contained in the response is the total number of results and remains constant as you requests additional pages. When you receive a response like:
{
"contents": [],
"count": 0, "total": 15, "lastId": 0
}
You have reached the end of the results.
Creating/Updating a Waitlist Request
Your application is able to create waitlist requests by making the following request:
POST {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/provider-portal/waitlists
{
"waitlistProviderId": 10003, "patientId": 7, "consultPriority": "Emergency", "consultStatus": "Waiting", "consultType": "Office Consult", "referralDate": "2020-03-31", "requestDate": "2020-03-31"
}
Above is an example containing only the required fields needed to create a waitlist booking request. Both the referralDate (date referral was sent) and the requestDate (date referral was received) are required and, in most cases, will be the same date.
The equivalent action in Accuro is shown below with the relevant fields highlighted. Note that currenly only access to Consult Waitlist Requests is available.
New Waitlist Request Adding Attachments
841

 Your application is able to attach either a document or letter (a.k.a encounter note) to an existing waitlist request. In order to successfully add an attachment, you will need:
An existing Waitlist Request and it’s ID
An existing document or letter that was previously created and it’s ID
Below is an example request:
POST {Accuro API base url}/rest/v1/provider- portal/waitlists/{waitlistRequestId}/attachments
[
{
itemId: 60040, itemCategory: "Document"
} ];
Waitlist Dates and Additional Information
If you recall Searching Waitlist Requests, it’s possible that more fields exist for a particular waitlist request than just the required fields and dates, e.g. firstConsultDate, patientAvailableForConsult etc. These dates are optional when creating a waitlist request due to the fact that waitlist dates are highly configurable.
Clinics are able to configure which dates are shown for the Consult tab when creating or viewing the details of a waitlist request. Your application should consult with the clinic on which dates exist on the Consult tab and what types of dates are expected to populate each field.
The other additional fields, like expedited, firstAvailable and others, can be populated when creating or updating a waitlist request. These are optional as clinics may like to populate these fields themselves or not use these at all. Clinics should be consulted for how these fields should be populated.
Waitlist Providers
To create a waitlist request associated with a provider, that provider needs to be configured as a waitlist provider. You are able to retrieve the list of providers currently configured for the Accuro Waitlist via the GET /v1/provider-portal/waitlist-providers which returns a result like:
[
{
id: 20003,
practitionerNumber: "1234", payeeNumber: "",
firstName: "David",
lastName: "Doctor", phoneNumber: "(___) ___-____", phoneExt: "", providerId: 12345,
active: true
} ];
The ID value 20003, is the Waitlist Provider ID and must be used as the waitlistProviderId field.
The providerId field can be used to cross-reference this list with the /v1/providers endpoint. Supporting Information
You are able to retrieve the list of current consult priorities, statuses, types and complaints through the following endpoints:
GET /v1/provider-portal/waitlist-consult-priorities GET /v1/provider-portal/waitlist-consult-statuses GET /v1/provider-portal/waitlist-consult- types
GET /v1/provider-portal/waitlist-consult-complaints
The create/update waitlist request endpoint expects the string value of the priority, status, type and complaint.

 Introduction
The document is created with an intent to give insight into Oscar EMR REST API working.
The document will cover the different endpoints supported by Oscar which are of relevance for BlockHealth. This document will only cover the following topics
1. Endpoints available
1. Request format for each endpoint 1. Response format for each endpoint. 1. Data types & character limits.
The document will cover topics which are independent of the technology used to implement API. Readers are free to use any programming language to implement the workflow in this document.
About Oscar EMR
OSCAR McMaster is a web-based electronic medical record (EMR) system initially developed for academic primary care clinics. It has grown into a comprehensive EMR and billing system used by many doctor's offices and private medical clinics in Canada and other parts of the world.
Blockhealth(Phelix)
By combining machine vision, natural language, and voice tools - Phelix can seamlessly automate most repetitive back office tasks, on any EMR or record system, winning back time that can be spent directly on patient care.
Phelix helps sort and process incoming faxes, populate patient profiles, extract disease or medication lists, transcribe reports, provides triage support, automate patient booking calls, appointment reminders, billing automation, prior authorizations and more.
REST API
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

 Pre-Requisites
In order to better understand this document users are required to have knowledge of the following topics
· REST API
· HTTP Protocol
· Oauth
Implementation
The section below details the steps involved in using REST API for Oscar.
Registration
For any application to be able to implement REST API for Oscar will have to register the application in the EMR. The steps to be followed are as below
1. Login to Oscar EMR and click on Admin tab as highlighted in figure below
1. Next, click on
Integration􏰀REST Clients
1. To Register a new application or client , click on
Add New
847

 1. Enter the name of the Client or application and add the callback url in URI. Click on Add Client. If there is no callback url then insert “oob”.
1. This will register the application and will generate Client Key & Client secret key which will be used for token exchange
Once the application is registered, we can start using the API. care.
Authorization:
In order to exchange the data with Oscar, the client will have to identify and authorize itself. Oscar EMR implements Oauth 1.0 for authorization.
Note: Please visit   OAuth Core 1.0 to learn about Oauth 1.0 OAuth Authentication is done in three steps:
1. The Consumer obtains an unauthorized Request Token.
1. The User authorizes the Request Token.
1. The Consumer exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token.
helps sort and process incoming faxes, populate patient profiles, extract disease or medication lists, transcribe reports, provides triage support, automate patient booking calls, appointment reminders, billing automation, prior authorizations and more.
Obtaining Request Token
The client must call the initiate authentication endpoint to generate a temporary token Endpoint: {base url}/ws/oauth/initiate
e.g https://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/oauth/initiate
The request format must be as follows POST /oscar/ws/oauth/initiate
Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="518kxdyx384w7q2o",oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",oauth_timestamp="1560686916",oauth_nonce="7u9 809hkvf",oauth_callback="oob",oauth_version="1.0",oauth_signature="7oc92hbk3pe4lwhi%26"

The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request. oauth_signature:
The signature as defined in Signing Requests. oauth_timestamp:
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp. oauth_nonce:
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp. oauth_version:
OPTIONAL. If present, value MUST be 1.0 . Service Providers MUST assume the protocol version to be 1.0 if this parameter is not present. Service Providers’ response to non-1.0 value is left undefined.
Response to the request is

 849

 Obtaining User Authorization
The Consumer cannot use the Request Token until it has been authorized by the User. Obtaining User authorization includes the following steps:
Once the token is received the application will redirect the user to
https://{base url}/ws/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=?
An example to look at is below
http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=d4a48e33-28ee-4ddd-9429-ac7022affd36
The user will need to login with his/her credentials and authorize the token.
850

 Once the user authorizes the token, the user will be redirected to the callback url. The response will also have oauth_verfier which will be used in final token exchange.
In the example, we have no callback url so oauth_verifier will be returned on the page.
Obtaining an Access Token
The Request Token and Token Secret MUST be exchanged for an Access Token and Token Secret.
To request an Access Token, the Consumer makes an HTTP request to the Service Provider’s Access Token URL The endpoint to call in this case is
http://{base url}/ws/oauth/token
Let’s look at a sample request
The endpoint we call is http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/oauth/token
The http request format is as follows
POST /oscar/ws/oauth/token
Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="518kxdyx384w7q2o",oauth_token="d4a48e33-28ee-4ddd-9429- ac7022affd36",oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",oauth_timestamp="1560689125",oauth_nonce="7u9809hkvz",oauth_verifier="80cd 0890-2bbd-4663-93c4-5af89fc356f6",oauth_version="1.0",oauth_callback="oob",oauth_signature="7oc92hbk3pe4lwhi%26afab4f09-03ec- 4f86-b413-9430a7a5cc4a"

oauth_consumer_key:
The Consumer Key.
oauth_signature_method:
The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request. oauth_consumer_key:
The oauth_verifier MUST be associated with the OAuth consumer and OAuth request token.

Note:The token never expires and can be used indefinitely.
These steps mark the completion of authorization process. All API calls to exchange data will use the access token, access secret key and oauth verifier token.
Fetching Demographics
Oscar provides following endpoints for demographics
· /demographics/{id} : Pulls demographic for a single patient and takes patient id as the input
· /demographics/search : Allows to search for patient on last name, first name, last name+firstname, HIN, dob,Phone, address and patient id
852

 Fetch Patient by Patient id:
This example illustrates an example of pulling demographics by patient id Endpoint: http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/services/demographics/128 Where 128 is the internal Oscar Patient id.
The response of the call is shown below

Searching Patient
Oscar allows patient search on one of the parameters Name, Phone, HIN, Address, DOB, ChartNo, DemographicNo We will look at an example of searching a patient by name
Endpoint: http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/services/demographics/search
The search parameters are part of the request body and the format is below
{
"type":"Name", "active":"True", "term":"Khan,Shanawaz", "integrator":"false", "outofdomain":"false"
}
854

 Type: Search parameter and can be one of the values(Name, Phone, HIN, Address, DOB, ChartNo, DemographicNo) Active: true: search for active patients, false: search for active and inactive patient.
Term: The search string
Integrator & outofdomain will always be set to false
Sample HTTP Request looks as below
URL: http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/services/demographics/search METHOD: POST
[HEADERS]
Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="brl6rc0byhw9n196",oauth_token="974e86d9-dc33-4101-81f2- 69c05ca6846d",oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",oauth_timestamp="1560697280",oauth_nonce="1zygnucap",oauth_verifier="5c21 b716-ea70-417e-8dac-2fddf694ddf9",oauth_version="1.0",oauth_signature="w2xp7ox85q2hg275%264fc1c4d3-7a8c-4d19-8bc4- c327a699e6b7"

} ],
"query" : null }
Above example shows how to search by name. We can also do a search by HIN by just changing the type variable to HIN in the HTTP payload request.
Fetching Providers
We can search for a provider by name using or pull a specific provider by passing the provider id
Endpoints:
/providerService/provider/{id}: Allows user to pull information of a specific provider where id is the Oscar internal provider id. /providerService/providers/search: Search provider by name.
We will look at an example of searching provider by name
The endpoint we call to search for provider is http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/services/providerService/providers/search
The search criteria passed as the HTTP request body and the format is as shown {

Fetching Appointments
Oscar provides following options to pull appointments
· /schedule/day/{date} : Pulls appointment for a date for all providers
· /schedule/getAppointment : Pulls a specific appointment when called with appointment id, else pulls all appointments. The system should never call this endpoint without the appointment id.
· /schedule/fetchMonthly/{providerNo}/{year}/{month}: Pulls appointment for specified month for a provider. We will look at an example of how to pull appointments for a date for all providers.
The endpoint we call is : http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/services/schedule/day/2019-05-28 The response to this call is:
{
"template":"patientlist/patientList1.jsp", "patients":[

Posting Appointments
The endpoint to post an appointment is /schedule/add Let’s look at an example of how to post appointment.
The endpoint we call to post appointment is http://104.196.58.23:8080/oscar/ws/services/schedule/add
860

 The payload format for posting an appointment is as shown
{
"providerNo":2,
"demographicNo":310, "name":"HASAN, AHMED", "status":"t", "startTime":"16:00", "reason":"",
"duration":"15", "appointmentDate":"2019-06-10"
}
Where providerNo: Internal provider id in Oscar demographicNo: Patient internal id in Oscar name: Patient Name
status: Appointment Status
startTime: Appointment Start time.
Reason: Appointment reason, this is a numerical value which is the internal id for the reason in Oscar. Duration: Duration of the appointment
appointmentDate: Date of appointment.
As we see above that we need to pass internal id for patient, provider, reason & status so there may have to call some additional endpoints before we post the appointment
The endpoints which we need to call before posting appointments are 1. Search provider by name: Covered in document above
1. Search provider by Patient: Covered in document above.
1. Status can be pre-synced with the EMR using the endpoint
/schedule/statuses
1. There is no endpoint to sync reason and will have to be synced by other means.

1. We will use the appointment response and Patient response to store the information in
records_patient_visit_integration table.
This record will be stored with Status=New and created_by=EMR.
Operation_type will be New if the appointment is new(means we do not have the appointment stored in the table)

Operation_type will be Update if the appointment already exists in the table. Example Sql query:
883

 IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM records_patient_visit_integration WHERE emr_appointment_no = p_Emr_Appointment_No AND clinic_id=p_ClinicId ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 1)
THEN
SET v_operationType = 'NEW'; ELSE
SET v_operationType = 'UPDATE';
1. If the record is of type NEW , Insert the data in table.
2. If the record is of Type Update, check if the pulled appointment has any updates using below query
IF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM records_patient_visit_integration
WHERE id=(SELECT id FROM
records_patient_visit_integration WHERE emr_appointment_no = p_Emr_Appointment_No ORDER BY
1 DESC LIMIT 1)
AND Emr_Provider_No = p_Emr_Provider_No
=p_Emr_Appointment_Date
AND appointment_date
AND start_time =p_start_time AND end_time =v_endTime
AND appointment_status =BINARY(v_status)
AND clinic_id =p_ClinicId ORDER BY created_datetime DESC LIMIT 1)
1. If the query returns 1, then skip this record and do not insert a new record
2. If the query returns nothing, then insert a new record with operation_type=UPDATE

 Integration - Waystar
Background
Typically when Phelix integrates with EMRs like Oscar, Accuro and INFINITT, the EMRs do the insurance lookup and pass the claims data to Phelix. However, as Phelix is now building a lot of workflows in the patient journey, we decided to take up the insurance processing too. To process insurance claims, Phelix will be integrating with Waystar.
Architecture
Rewrite Referrals MX, which will interact with Claims MX. Create a microservice (MX) for Claims Processing called Claims MX, which will interface with Waystar
Workflow
Phelix will receive a referral via Fax, Phone, Email (or any other channel), and create a referral record
As soon as the referral is received, the Referral MX will send the referral data (Patient information, Patient insurance information, Referring doctor, Requested procedure, Priority of the referral, Clinic information (service provider)) to the Claims MX.
As soon as the Claims MX receives this data, it will send the Client ID and Secret to Recondo Auth and get the Token (Page 22-25) As soon as the Token is received by the Claims MX, it will hit the /loadAccount endpoint in Waystar and pass over all referral data
received from the Referral MX
Waystar return with ACK or NACK (Page 17-21)
ACK
Move on
NACK
Phelix user corrects the referral data
Manual intervention could be needed
Phelix repeats this step automatically (click)
AuthInitiate
Load Account processes through all of Waystar’s products (see Page 28 of the API Doc PDF) in the backend (as far as it possibly
can) and as there are material changes in the account status, Waystar posts an asynchronous response back to the URL sent in the initial request (provided by Phelix)
After hitting the Load Account once, Phelix is going to receive numerous responses as they account progresses through the insurance eligibility process so it’s important for Phelix to capture and parse the latest response all the time; each subsequent POST should contain the latest data in the payload
If any additional details are needed, Phelix can always use the Retrieve 271 Response endpoint or Retrieve Account Status endpoint Phelix user will click a button in the UI to initiate a claim
In the backend, we will pass the referral data to Waystar: Patient information, Patient insurance information, Referring doctor, Requested procedure, Clinic information (service provider)
And this data will also be populated in the launched link
If any further info is needed, Phelix user answers clinical questions (if required)
Auth check
Auth not required Auth required
Waystar Deeplink
905

 Waystar API processes the claim and returns appropriate status (approved, denied, partially-approved etc.) - which can sometimes take days
approved - nothing further
partially approved - patient has to pay
Go to Patient Payment
missing items - submit missing info
Phelix/Phelix user manually or automatically updates the referral data or procedure data
After getting the required data, repeat Claim Submission denied - patient has to pay
Phelix/Phelix user manually or automatically updates the referral data or procedure data
After getting the required data, repeat Claim Submission or no further action refer Waystar API docs
Invoice MX Integration
To calculate how much the patient owes Issue invoices in the Web App
Form Builder Integration
Based on the actions patient has to take for above workflows
Phelix collects copay from the patient using Payment (Smart Element) in Form Builder The Waystar API endpoint used for this will be EligibilityPlus Processing

 Sequence diagram for Claims Mx
 Waystar Documentation
Auth Required
Endpoint to check Prior Authorization. It can take up to 10 business days to approve or deny a prior auth. If the request has been completed properly, meets the insurance provider’s criteria and falls under coverage outlined in the patient’s plan, the request will be approved. If more information is needed, the insurance provider will communicate with the doctor’s office or hospital to sort out the details. But if a denial is issued, a patient could be confronted with delays or rescheduled care, or in some cases an outright inability to get the treatment they need.

 Waystar - Revenue Cycle API Overview What is the Revenue Cycle API?
Our Revenue Cycle API allows you to load patient visit details and asynchronously (not in real-time) receive processing status updates as well as request processing details. We built the Revenue Cycle API using Representational State Transfer (REST) principles against predicable URLs. All REST calls follow HTTP rules, and all resources are exposed URLs.

Our intelligence platform sits between providers and payers to help translate the many pieces of benefit and cost information in the healthcare revenue cycle. We generate content across the revenue cycle: eligibility, authorization status, patient estimates, and more. We believe good content is key to winning in the revenue cycle. Even with standards like ASCI X12 EDI and related code sets, the resulting responses aren’t enough to tell patient access or back office staff what to do, in some cases don’t return what you need, and in many cases do not even have the information you are looking for. Often, payer websites have more up-to-date data and information than EDI.
Our platform’s set of web-enhanced data, payer rules engines, and workflow actions create better content and more content for you to drive your revenue cycle. We also believe in treating the patient encounter in the revenue cycle holistically, and have combined the majority of our Revenue Cycle API functionality into as few endpoints as possible, while allowing you and your development team to only use what you need.
Products available through the Revenue Cycle API
The following are the Recondo (now part of Waystar) products that are available using the Revenue Cycle API. However, to use these products you must have them licensed.
SurePayHealth
Helps hospitals and other providers across the U.S. to verify patient identity and insurance eligibility, and to calculate an accurate patient statement at Point of Service using managed care contracts, charge master data, and the patient’s insurance benefit information (if insured). By ensuring data quality on the front end of the revenue cycle, hospitals can reduce back-office rework as well as full-time employees required to manage bad debt and write-offs.
EligibilityPlus
Provides real-time eligibility verification and the most comprehensive benefit response available. Your organization needs to know more than if a patient is eligible under a particular insurance plan; it needs to know the specific benefits for the services that your organization provides. With integrated electronic data interchange (EDI) and payer web-portal benefits, EligibilityPlus gives your organization the specific benefits it needs to accurately assess and complete eligibility and benefit verification. Identifying patient eligibility and benefit plan details early in the revenue cycle allows for faster patient collections and more accurate claim submission, which improves revenue collection and cash flow while reducing administrative expenses
Auth-DP (Authorization Denial/Prevention)
Allows your patient-access staff to identify whether an authorization is required and the status of that authorization prior to service, ensuring that your organization provides service only with the approved authorization in place. Missing or incorrect authorization information causes hospitals to write off millions of dollars every year. For many hospitals, claim denials represent the greatest financial challenge across the revenue cycle. By reducing authorization denials, revenue cycle management teams can redirect staff members to focus on other areas of the revenue cycle.
910

 Auth-DP functionality resides in the following modules, which your organization can license:
AuthInitiate web application and module, powered by our patented bot technology, initiates and helps complete a prior-authorization
request for scheduled procedures (healthcare services).
AuthStatus determines whether an authorization is required for a given payer/procedure. The module automates the process of
retrieving the authorization number and status directly from the payer website. It then finds and lists authorization exceptions, allowing patient-access staff to focus on denial prevention.
AuthNotification uses an EDI authorization message (also known as the 278N Services Review Notification) to provide Admission Notification to United Healthcare. By using this solution, providers inform United Healthcare of a patient’s admission in a timely manner thus avoiding financial penalties. Payers use this information to coordinate care with the hospital for that patient.
AuthSubmit initiates authorization requests on behalf of a facility or physician for unplanned inpatient direct admissions. This helps provide timely notification to the payer along with ensuring that there is an authorization on file prior to providing services, which helps reduce denials due to lack of notification/authorization.
MedicalNecessity and advance beneficiary notice (ABN) uses national and local Medicare policies (see links below) to help determine if services will be covered under Medicare’s criteria. Though this is only available for outpatient services, it can easily prevent Medicare denials and make the patient aware that they will not be covered for the procedure. By federal statute, Medicare can only pay for items and services that are "reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member." Medicare has a number of policies, including National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) and Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), formerly known as Local Medical Review Policies (LMRP), that describe coverage criteria.
Revenue Cycle API business value
The Revenue Cycle API provides automated data that you can incorporate into your reporting and metrics. You can have it feed directly into your own existing applications, reducing the need for your users to switch between multiple applications, which greatly increases their efficiency.
For specific data fields and business values of each endpoint/sub-model, see the appropriate endpoint topic in this documentation.
HIPAA compliance and proper handling of PHI
As a Business Associate to our clients, we take Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance very seriously. The patient’s Protected Health Information (PHI) used in our products must be treated in accordance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations (HHS.gov website).
Toward that end, you must use standard security measures to ensure that PHI cannot be accessed by anyone other than authorized users. These measures include
Protecting login information to prevent unauthorized use.
Logging out of the product portal when leaving a work station or when the portal will be idle. Using appropriately secured methods to communicate with Client Support when PHI is involved.
When contacting Client Support:
Never send PHI in an unsecured email.
If you need to communicate with us about a particular transaction that requires a screen print, make sure to mask any PHI with an opaque marker.

 Waystar - Important Considerations
RESTful
The Revenue Cycle API is built using REST principles against predicable URLs to streamline application development.
All REST calls follow HTTP rules, and all resources are exposed URLs.
All calls made to further processing on an account or retrieve a status on an account will be asynchronous. The Revenue Cycle API is currently in active development ,and all aspects are subject to change.
Data mapping is really important
Data mapping is one of the most critical parts of deploying the Revenue Cycle API into a customer's environment. That's why it's so
important that you review the Data mapping topic in this documentation. This will help ensure success as you build to the API.
It is critical to synchronize the data models between your development environment, the client’s environment, and the Recondo/Waystar platform to correctly map the data models (payers, procedures, patient types and service, locations of service, and so on) to ensure that the production API works as intended with our platform.
While test messages and data will give you the appropriate details to build and test API functionality, making the API work in a customer’s environment will take an extra step to align our data models, and we’ll be happy to support you during the process.
Why you need to care:
Some providers call Outpatient Surgery “OP-Surgery,” while others call it “1.”
Some providers use coded data, others use mnemonics, some are standards-based, some are not.
Each provider environment is unique.
There is variation in the data (HL7 ADT and SIU) that drives the patient encounter.
Relationships to subscribers, patient types and services, payer names/IDs, and so forth, will be different from site to site, and are different from third- party to third-party.
So, yes, data mapping is a big deal.
The Revenue Cycle API is provider-centric
Typically, most APIs give universal access to a dataset that was created to be as universal as possible. And once you code to the test API, you can move into a production environment and “go-live” without changing the data used to call the API. Healthcare environments, however, make it slightly more complex.
Not every client has every product/application service in our platform.
Data is not consistent from site to site.
Providers have different contracts and rates that drive patient estimates.
Third parties, providers, and Recondo/Waystar have different lists of payers with different payerIDs.
How data is mapped is critical to the success of the API. So once you’ve developed a working test application, the next step is to deploy to the customer’s environment, where we will align our data models. For more data-mapping information, see the Data mapping topic in this documentation.
912

 Patient-encounter API model
Our API model was designed around the concept of a patient encounter. That means we treat as much of a patient’s revenue cycle encounter as holistically as possible. When there are changes to a patient’s location of service, procedures, or coverage, it all affects the encounter. Rather than generate a large number of API endpoints that you have to keep track of and coordinate, we’ve limited the endpoints to drive some simplicity in designing to our specification.
Why is the API asynchronous?
Because our product platform uses our patented bots along with EDI and provider processes, such as authorization, not all responses in the revenue cycle occur in real time as we merge data across sources, different standards, and different temporal events. As an example, you may find that for a particular patient encounter, an eligibility response for a payer with strong EDI may come in before you receive an authorization status response, but you do not want to wait for the authorization to get the information you need.
We also understand that patient encounters change—eligibility changes, procedures change, locations of service change—so we’ve designed the API to always proactively send you the most current account status across the entire revenue cycle. As the encounter changes, and as our platform delivers the content, we always update the entire Revenue Cycle API response with all the patient-encounter content that was provisioned. In this way, your application does not need to continually poll our API for a response.
High-level processing
Most endpoints provided in the Revenue Cycle API allow access to Recondo/Waystar processing in an asynchronous (not real-time) manner. This means that requests to the Revenue Cycle API must include a “reply to” address to which the fully processed API response will ultimately be sent. It is also because of the asynchronous nature of the Revenue Cycle API processing that the immediate response body to every request to the API will be a brief “Message Acknowledgement”, either an “Acknowledged” or a “Not Acknowledged” (ACK/NACK) which will indicate to the requestor if their request has successfully been submitted through the Revenue Cycle API for processing. This response will include any request errors that prevented the request from being processed in the case of the NACK.
Diagram example (Load Account)
 913

 ACK/NACK response format
An “acknowledged” or “not acknowledged” message is a JSON response with the following schema:
 1{
2 "messageId": "string"
3 "accountNumber": "string"
4 "facilityId": "string"
5 "acknowledged": boolean,
6 "errors": [
7 8] 9}
"string"
The elements of this model are as follows:
Element
messageId
acknowledged
errors
Data type
UUID (as String)
Boolean
Array (of Strings)
Description
A unique identifier for the request, to be used to correlate requests and responses.
Indicator of whether or not the request was submitted for processing successfully. True for a successful request was successfully submitted, False otherwise.
A listing of any data validation/request errors that occurred while attempting to submit the request for processing.
        accountNumber
   String
  The unique number assigned by your organization’s Health Information System (HIS). This is the account number provided to the Revenue Cycle API in the request for which this ACK/NACK is being sent.
  facilityId
    String
   The location where a patient's healthcare service is performed, as defined by your organization. This is the facility identifier provided to the Revenue Cycle API in the request for which this ACK/NACK is being sent.
       The following is an example ACK/NACK response:
 1{
2 "messageId": "339fca21-80d2-4181-9021-780d2993de86",
3 "accountNumber": "",
4 "facilityId": "1234567890",
5 "acknowledged": false,
6 "errors": [
7 "Account number is required and must not be blank"
8] 9}
Response Requirements
This section should give you an idea of the level of effort required to get both test responses and real responses from the Revenue Cycle API.
Test Response
What you need for test responses:
A digital token must be acquired from us to give you access to the Revenue Cycle API. The token must be present on all requests to the Revenue Cycle API.
A test application capable of making HTTP requests and displaying the basic responses.
A test application capable of receiving the asynchronous messages.
Real Response
914

 What you need for real responses:
A digital token must be acquired from us to give you access to the Revenue Cycle API. The token must be present on all requests to the Revenue Cycle API.
An application capable of making HTTP requests and processing the basic responses.
An application capable of processing the asynchronous messages.
Initial mapping data. This depends on the products selected; see the Data mapping section for more information. The time investment here is entirely dependent on the amount of data. Three facilities with a few dozen physicians will be much faster than 40 facilities and 1000 physicians.
Payer website credentials. We require payer website credentials for our automated solutions. These website credentials will power our
patented bots, which automatically go out to payer websites and retrieve the necessary data.
Initial environment setup. We will need time and dedicated coordination to setup both Staging and Production environments.
Initial settings. Many of our products have additional tools and alerts that can be turned on/off. You will need to work with us to determine the settings that work best for you.
Implementation time is strongly driven by the timeliness of your responses for data that is needed to configure your environment. If you are already using our products and would like to add the Revenue Cycle API, this additional integration will likely be a much shorter process.
OAuth2 authentication
All requests require a valid OAuth2 Bearer token to successfully interact with the Revenue Cycle API. Initial setup with our Infrastructure and IT team needs to take place to establish the process for obtaining and maintaining valid OAuth2 tokens. At its most basic, we will create a customerId and a token secret. Using this combination, you will be able to request OAuth2 tokens, which you will attach to any requests you make.
The Revenue Cycle API supports:
Client authentication through OAuth2.
Encryption over HTTPS for calls to the Revenue Cycle API.
Example JSON token call
The following is an example of a JSON call to retrieve a token using Postman.
  1{
2 "info": {
3 "_postman_id": "253fce1a-ce1d-454f-a8d7-b7f449cb0808",
4 "name": "reco api",
5 "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json" 6 }, "item": [
7{
8 "name": "https://api.recondohealth.net/oauth2/token", "request": {
9 "auth": {
10 "type": "basic", "basic": [
11 {
12 "key": "password", "value": "xxxxx", "type": "string"
13 }, { "key": "username", "value": "xxxxx", "type": "string" 14 } ]
15 },
16 "method": "POST", "header": [
17 {
18 "key": "Content-Type",
19 "name": "Content-Type",
20 "value": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "type": "text" 21 } ],
915

  Example shell script token cURL call
The following is an example shell script cURL call to retrieve a token.
 1 CLIENT_ID=your_id
2 CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
3 BASIC_HEADER=`echo -n "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64` BASIC_HEADER=$(echo $BASIC_HEADER | sed 's/\r//g') B 4 echo $BASIC_HEADER
5 curl -v -i -H "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_HEADER" -d "grant_type=client_credentials" https://api.recondohealth.
Calling the Revenue Cycle API
Request URLs are relative to the following endpoint: /revenueCycleApiService/rcas/v1/
So an example of a request URL might be something like: rcas.recondohealth.net:8080/revenueCycleApiService/rcas/v1/loadAccount
HTTP methods
The Revenue Cycle API exposes a variety of different endpoints that can be accessed using different HTTP methods. The information in this documentation for a particular resource will indicate the supported HTTP methods and their expected behaviors.
Method Description
GET Retrieves a resource.
POST Creates a new resource or performs an action. PUT Updates an existing resource.
DELETE Deletes an existing resource.
API Call Response codes
The Revenue Cycle API returns HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate a success, the 4xx range indicates an error in the request, and errors in the 5xx range indicate errors related to server-side processing. For example:
Status Code Description
A n
                200 OK
  22 "body": {
23 "mode": "urlencoded", "urlencoded": [
24 {
25 "key": "grant_type",
26 "value": "client_credentials", "type": "text"
27 } ]
28 },
29 "url": {
30 "raw": "https://api.recondohealth.net/oauth2/token", "protocol": "https", 31 "host": [
32 "api", "recondohealth", "net"
33 ], "path": [
34 "oauth2",
35 "token" ]
36 } },
37 "response": [] }
38 ] }
916

   400 Invalid data in request
    Account error handling
Any errors that occur before the message is sent to our Automated Transaction Processing (ATP) will result in a response sent to your organization with an error message indicating what occurred with the transaction. The Revenue Cycle API has a specific HTTP endpoint for error messages. The “reply to” address from an original request will be used to send error responses back to your organization.
Response
Content Model Description
Account Error Response A JSON representation of the account’s error response.
      The “Account Error Response” is a JSON response following the model described as:
 1{
2 "messageId": "string",
3 "errorMessage": "string",
4 “supportMessage”: “string”
5}
The elements of this model are:
Element
messageId
errorMessage
supportMessage
Example Response
Required data by product
Data type
UUID (as String)
String
String
Description
A unique identifier for the request used to correlate requests and responses.
An error that occurred while attempting to submit the request for processing.
The support message should read “For further Recondo support, please call 888-732-6672”.
                1{
2 "messageId": "3632ae0f-1179-4ea2-8be2-d8bbb0c09db4",
3 "errorMessage": "No account found for request",
4 "supportMessage": "For further Recondo support, please call 888-732-6672"
5}
Each product has its own list of data required to fully process an encounter. An account does not need to process in every product but be aware of what data is required for the products you have licensed, enabled, and want to process through with the Revenue Cycle API.
Note: For insurance information, if the patient is self-pay, that is the only"insurance"data we need. If they are insured, we also need the Policy Number and the Patient Relationship to Subscriber (policy holder). If the relationship is not SELF, we will also require the subscriber’s first and last name.
Base (for all products) required data is Facility, Date of Service, Patient Last Name, Patient First Name, Patient Gender, Patient Date of Birth, and at least one payer.
SurePayHealth required data is Patient Type/Service and Procedure(s). EligibilityPlus does not require any additional data.
AuthStatus required data is PatientType/Service andProcedure(s).
917

 AuthSubmit required data is AdmissionType, PatientType/Service, Admitting or Attending Physician, Procedure, and Length of Stay. AuthNotification required data is Admission Type, Patient Type/Service, Reason for Visit, and Admitting or Attending Physician. MedicalNecessity required data is Patient Type, Procedure(s),and Diagnosis Code(s).

Other Points - WIP
A user interface/experience must be created in Phelix for consumption of Waystar content. For example, consumption and display of eligibility responses, alerts, auth numbers, estimates (and breakdown), and other visual Add on systems may need to be developed for successful API integration.
There is always an ability to deep link into the Waystar application for any non-ATP reason or event.
Getting Tokens and API access
Sample curl commands to get tokens for API call access to devpartner sandbox .
When we stand up the API/Infinitt environment, we can cut production API keys
Designing for Asynchronous & Encounter Behavior
Waystar’s platform runs asynchronously for certain operations (think of a bot obtaining a status from a payer web site). We post material changes to your endpoint. This helps reduce polling overhead...and you can always get an account status update from the endpoint if you have not maintained state.
Waystar’s platform is encounter based – we will attempt to process transactions through for as many products as we can based on the information you give us in the load account call.
Developers coding to the API should consider try/retry logic for proper account handling (ex. Eligibility vs. Eligibility+Auth+Estimation)
Patient Type and Service Driven data
Our rules and processes are also heavily based on patient types and services – this is important in discovering accurate benefits for estimation calculations, auth portal routing, and many other tasks. In this case, we will mostly deal with Outpatient Radiology, making this concept much easier.
Common Mistakes
Not implementing NACK logging and connecting to retry logic (review Eligibility + SPH example).
Unmapped data to Waystar value set (review relationship to subscriber) – upstream systems need to adopt the Waystar values in the API guide.
918

 Waystar - Data Mapping
What is the deal with data mapping?
It is critical to synchronize the data models between your development environment, the client’s environment, and the Recondo/Waystar platform to correctly map the data models (payers, procedures, patient types and service, locations of service, and so on) to ensure that the production API works as intended with our platform.
While test messages and data will give you the appropriate details to build and test API functionality, making the API work in a customer’s environment will take an extra step to align our data models, and we’ll be happy to support you during the process.
Why you need to care:
Some providers call Outpatient Surgery “OP-Surgery,” while others call it “1.”
Some providers use coded data, others use mnemonics, some are standards-based, some are not.
Each provider environment is unique.
There is variation in the data (HL7 ADT and SIU) that drives the patient encounter.
Relationships to subscribers, patient types and services, payer names/IDs, and so forth, will be different from site to site, and are different from third- party to third-party.
So, yes, data mapping is a big deal.
What data needs mapping?
As a step in request processing, the Revenue Cycle API will translate a number of input request fields from values supplied in the request into normalized values used during internal processing. The following fields will undergo this data mapping operation:
Facility names
Gender values (patient gender, subscriber gender, etc.)
Relationship codes (the patient’s relationship to the subscriber).
Patient Type and Service
Payer names (insurance company)
Physician names (and IDs)
Procedure codes
Diagnosis codes( we do not need HIS data for this, the mapping is provided to make requests easier)
It will be a necessary operational step to establish correct and complete data mappings between your organization’s Hospital Information System (HIS) values and our internal values for these fields, for any user of the Revenue Cycle API.
It should also be noted that a failure to accurately map these data elements will result in failed Revenue Cycle API requests, producing NACK responses from the API with an appropriate error code returned.
Facility names
Facility names are unique to each Recondo/Waystar environment and are typically a numeric string of values like, “12345678910.” As we take a combined solution to a client, we will provide the provisioned IDs to you for a production go-live.
Gender values
The Recondo/Waystar-mapped gender values are as follows:
  Recondo Value Description (if needed)
  919

   Female Male Unknown
Example mapping that you and your organization may need to perform during your customer’s implementation:
      HIS Value
F
f FEMALE female M
m
MALE
Relationship codes
Recondo Value (to map to)
Female Female Female Female Male Male Male
                The following are supported values for relationship-to-subscriber information. As an example, if the host HIS solution has a value of “wife” or “husband,” it would be mapped to the Recondo/Waystar value of “1” (aka Spouse).
  Recondo Value (to map to)
1 18 19 34
Patient Type and Service
Description (if needed)
Spouse Self
Child Other Adult
          For each patient encounter that you load to the API, a required Patient Type and Service is needed to appropriately map and route requests in our platform. Not all patient types and services are coded the same within a provider organization’s HIS system. Please note that you will want to map those values to one of our standard patient type class names and medical service class names below:
        Patient Type Class Name
Clinic
Emergency
Emergency Room Inpatient
Medical Service Class Name AuthNotification AuthStatus

Payer names
✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔
✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔
                             Payer names also vary significantly between partners, providers, and Recondo/Waystar. We’ve found that most of us have a payer list with some unique identifiers. For example, for some the payer name is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, while others use BCBS Texas. As you develop your solution, please keep in mind that we will need to map and align payers with our mutual customer. You’ll find an example list of payer names and IDs in our test data set. Here is a sample of the type of information you will see.
  Sample Payer Name
Aetna
Medicaid of Kentucky
United Healthcare
Standard Life and Accident Ins Co Self-Pay
Physician names (and IDs)
Recondo Payer API Value
REC0100 REC1870 REC1610 REC5130 SELFPAY
            Our platform can take in different physician information for related authorization and eligibility events. As your solution moves from the test endpoint to a mutual customer’s environment, both your organization and Recondo/Waystar will need to make sure that the available physician mapping is provided to your organization for population. The following fields are available to populate in the message response:
  Field Name
Physician First Name Physician Last Name Physician ID
Procedure codes
Recondo Value (illustrative)
Robert Smith 12345
        When obtaining pricing estimates and certain authorizations, procedure codes become important. For pricing, our platform relies upon two methods to generate price estimates. In most cases, standard ICD and CPT procedure codes is the easiest method used to generate prices estimates. Our platform does not re-license, or publish these codes, and most organizations need to purchase a license from an official source. We recommend using the following resources to explore standard code sets:
AMA Finding Coding Resources
CMS ICD-10 (look for PCS and GEMs) CMS HCPCS Quarterly Update
The second method of obtaining estimates that our platform supports is the usage of a scheduled procedure Mnemonic. Whether a healthcare provider uses a codified element like “349284902,” or a text string like “Colonoscopy,” that Mnemonic usually maps to a common procedure. For example, a Colonoscopy, while general in description could map to a variety of procedure codes, like a 45378 or 45380. Each healthcare provider site is unique in this mapping, and is unique in their use of Mnemonics. We help each provider map the Mnemonic to a procedure, so during deployment of your solution, and our API client, we will need to make the mappings known to you. Or, you can map the Mnemonic to the client’s preferred procedure code set(s), and send that to our platform.
For authorizations, it is important to always know the procedure for which authorization status is to be requested, and it is a required element for authorization operations.
923

 Diagnosis codes
When determining authorization, diagnosis codes are also often required to process operations within our authorization platform. Our platform does not re- license, or publish these codes, and most organizations need to purchase a license from an official source. We recommend using the following resources to explore standard code sets:

 Waystar - Revenue Cycle API - Cancel Account
  Endpoint Supported HTTP Methods
/cancelAccount POST
Caution: After an account is cancelled, it cannot be un-cancelled.
The Cancel Account resource provides the ability to cancel an existing account such that no further processing will occur on the account within any of our products supported in the environment. Response to a Cancel Account request will be an ACK/NACK indicating if the account cancellation request was successfully received and sent to our services to halt further processing.
See the Element descriptions topic for the elements that are required.
Note: Receiving an ACK response for a Cancel Account request does not mean that the account was successfully cancelled. It means that the request to cancel the account was valid and was submitted for processing. If, for example, no account is found in our system with the account number supplied in the request, the Cancel Account request will be ineffectual.

Referral status = incomplete Incomplete for 2 reasons :
Missing items (incomplete status = missing items)
notification sent to referring provider
If Recondo Eligibility Integration is OFF (i.e. simple Canadian case)
button in UI for staff ‘Complete’
click complete, referral status = received
If recondo Eligibility integration is ON
button in UI for staff : Eligibility Check once clicked → Referral status = received
Send to recondo eligibility check
Eligibility = false (incomplete status = eligibilty false) Go in Incomplete with Eligibility Status False
Patient receives notification + self pay option
if patient self pays, auth status = Self pay, and drop into Booking Queue if patient pays = booking checkpoint (triggered once patient has paid) once patient books = Referral Booked
Referral Received / Triage
Referral status = received
if recondo Eligibility integration is ON
Send to recondo for eligibility check (Relay error to the front end - block creation referral) ‘Book Appointment’ button in UI
if appointment manually booked, or appointment booked from EMR, update referral status = booked (move to Booked tab)
if ‘AutoBook’ selected, trigger Auto-Book checkpoint and move to referral status = in Booking (Booking queue) → Implement later
If Recondo Eligibility Integration is ON if false
Referral status = incomplete Incomplete status = eligibility false see workflow above
True (whether initially or once updated) patient moves into Booking Queue

a. Recondo only returns what’s on the portal. User will have to go into portal immediately (usually only have 24- 48) to action . oftentimes, there is no timeline listed but should be tended to immediately (need to be put in workflow to be actioned immediately)

 Authentication and authorization process
This document is used for maintaining details flows of the authentication and authorization process Long term approach
 Short term approach
970

  For short term, we can use API key and client id authentication using keycloak and Nginx it is quick and easy to implement in the current situation but it is not reliable for long-term use.
Government of Canada Standards on APIs
  971

 Authentication and authorization with keycloak Long term and final approach
 Notes
The process we are using here is PCKE and Authorization code Oauth protocol
Front needs to call keycloak directly for authentication and for acquiring an access token While onboarding a partner using microservice we need to make entry in keycloak as well

 Ory Hydra VS Keycloak
    Business Requirements
Support both internal and external API usage (particular focus on external developer API → setup within minutes, use any external API with client ID/secret)
Migration to the new web app front end
Security practices in accordance with HL7/FHIR and other health apps
Scalability/customization for the future (100,000 calls per hour, 1M+ calls per hour)
SSO with Okta / Azure / any other solution
Cost
flexibility
Ory Hydra
Yes ory hydra supports PKCE and client id and client secret both
Ory kretos required for user and identity management
Note: if we have less number of users it better to migrate from old DB since we are planning to move away from PHP app and DB
For FHIR, we are planning to a custom gateway so we can play around the authentication with any system
its light weight and cloud native so, its completely scalable horizontally
There is no clear examples or documentation for integration with Okta but it supports Ory hydra via OIDC
all component are open sources, but enterprise cloud version is paid, and for cost need to connect with their sales team
Ory hydra doesn’t shipped with any specific template engine, hence it flexible for front end integration as well
For ory we can only use required packages
Keycloak
Yes keycloak, also supports PKCE and client id and client secret both
Yes it supports connection with existing user DB
For FHIR, we are planning to a custom gateway so we can play around the authentication with any system
it is scalable but its bit tricky to scale it as it heavy in nature
Yeah there is example and support present in the community for okta integration via OIDC
its open sources completely
Keycloak is shipped with specific template engine so it is very hard to integrate with UI and to provide custom implementation on front end
For keycloak we need to use complete package, regardless of their usage

 Points to discuss with GCP experts
We need to discuss following points with GCP experts about AA ( authentication and authorization systems )
Opaque tokens vs JWT from healthcare industry perspective
Since we are dealing with highly sensitive data (PHI) which access token technique we should use ?
Which IAM system is better from scalability and customization point of view, ory hydra or keycloak ? Which system we should consider for integration with different authentication provider like okta ?
Since we are considering ory hydra or keycloak as IAM system we need to discuss on which we should use, to integrate with other id providers systems easily
Which IAM system you can recommend from HIPAA compliance point of view ?
NOTE :
Since we are still under discussion for IAM system, please feel free to provide, recommendation for other IAM system from apart from keycloak or ory hydra

 FormBuilder Patient Booking
Patient Verification:
Patient Provides basic info: FirstName, LastName, HCN, Phone
PhelixSearch: Search phelix database referral_patient_info table and find best possible match
based on HCN and Phone match . EMRSearch: Search Oscar RestAPI demographics search API
APIEndpoint: /ws/services/demographics/search
EMR Search has multiple stages:
Search with HCN, Phone, Name and look after CellPhone
For CellPhone lookup need another OSCAR_APIEndpoint: /ws/services/demographics/{demographic_id} - If find a Patient in EMR then match this record with Phelix Patient if any exists .
- If no match found or no phelix_patient is there then have to create a patient in phelix_db table referral_patient_info with the details of emr_patient .
- If no emr_patient found then terminate the workflow here unless there is a create patient option .
- If create patient is enabled then collect details patient info and create a patient in emr ( EndPoint /ws/services/demographics/ ) and in phelix db table referral_patient_info .
- following this process to get an emr_patient .
- If there is no EMR patient then PatientVerification fails and user get an unsuccessful error message .
If PatientVerification pass then we start Appointment booking:
AppointmentBooking:
- check for family_doctor or walkin settings
- if family_doctor settings enabled then follow familyDoctorWorkflow
- else if walkin settings enabled then follow WalkInAppointmentWorkflow
familyDoctorWorkflow:
- check if emr_patient has falimy doctor
- within emr_patient information get providerId
- if there is a providerId then we have to check phelix db table clinic_physician_info and have to get corresponding id , this ID is the physician_id .
- if there is a physician_id then we have to make slot search MX API call
http://dev.api.blockhealth.co/appointment/oscar/physician/available-slots
- if appointment slots exists display to the patient
- and mark those as temporarily reserved using phelix db table clinic_physician_temp_reservation
- patient selects an appointment slot and book the slot using appointment MX API http://dev.api.blockhealth.co/appointment
WalkInAppointmentWorkflow:
- search for physician in phelix db table clinic_physician_info - for all the physicians make individual slot search MX API calls
http://dev.api.blockhealth.co/appointment/oscar/physician/available-slots
- display all the slots grouped by respective physician to the patient
- and mark those as temporarily reserved using phelix db table clinic_physician_temp_reservation
- patient selects an appointment slot and book the slot using appointment MX API http://dev.api.blockhealth.co/appointment

 Improved traceability of a request across the microservices
Case 1 : Request generated by front end
In this case whenever frontend is hitting any request to backend, they should generate a unique id and must put this unique id is header x-
unique-id, e.g.x-unique-id: “1b9d6bcd-bbfd-4b2d-9b5d-ab8dfbbd4bed“
Case 2 : Request generated in backend for sync or for integration with other external service
In this case service from where request is originated by a microservice as part of sync and external service integration, when originating microservice should generate it x-unique-id header and persist it in its DB as a log for tracing purpose in case any issues
  983

  NOTE : x-unique-id header is mandatory header and consumer of API must send it

  UX recommendation for IVR flows
I think the UX should be simpler to create IVR flows, Please check this simpler UX here.

   SMS and Web chat Preferences
There is no scope for a drag and drop flow builder for SMS and Web chatbot. The SMS and Web chat directly connect with the BOT interpreter MX and send message to the chat bot. All the messages coming to the chat bot will match with one intent or no intent. Bot will generate responses as it configured in it.
We can have a Chat bot preferences UI to enable and disable different chat intents for different users/customers.

New structure - ApptType based template codes. - NOT implemented AS REQUIREMENT CHANGED
Currently we are using template code when fetching slots, now we need support to fetch slots without sending template code but need to set apptType based on value of template code in fetched slot.
So, introduced new property "templateCodeMode":"auto", // auto/manual in the book appointment applet structure.
if "templateCodeMode":"auto”
fetch slots without using any value for template code check template code value for selected slot

  New Structure: Allowed Provider IDs New property=> "allowedProviders":[123,124,244,566]
if allowedProviders has any values, restrict booking appointments only to the given provider ids in allowedProviders.
So check the provider id in patient details if found in the allowed providers array. if not found got to No-slot or No-physician case.
if allowedProviders is undefined or null, proceed with the provider id in the patient details.

 Flow executor
 Communication b/w Telecom MX and the Flow executor
Telecom MX will post flow ID, path and flow position values along with the session object
Session object will contain uuid (unique id for every call), phone number and caller id.
Flow executor can add additional values to the session object, those values will be carried through out all the transactions. The Flow executor should respond with flow, next and session values.
Error response: If the flow executor fails to find and return flow, it should return error as follows along with session. { error: “system_error“, error_description:” No flow found with provided ID”}

 There’s an example config file we’ll copy and edit:
 1 mv /etc/rtpengine/rtpengine.sample.conf /etc/rtpengine/rtpengine.conf 2
3 vi /etc/rtpengine/rtpengine.conf
Update config content file with that given in the gitlab repository. Now we can start the service:
1 /etc/init.d/ngcp-rtpengine-daemon start
Unimrcp
Home
The Unimrcp server can be installed as described here   Debian Installation Manual
Then, install GSR plugin as per instructions here   GSR Installation Manual
Documentation on Freeswitch and unimrcp integration are here   FreeSWITCH GSR Usage Manual
      1259

 Dev environment
The dev environment consists of a single Freeswitch server which receives calls from the Telnyx and executes the IVR using the ESL application running in it. There is another instance running with Unimrcp server which handle requests for speech recognition.
NOTE: The unimrcp server has a 2 channel license which is related with instance internal IP and mac address. So its internal IP is reserved in the GCP, ensure to reassign the same internal IP when makes changes on the instance.

 Request tracking in google Logs Explorer
Overview
As the new improvement in logging of microservices, we have added JSON-based logging in microservices which includes the following details along with the standard message to log
endpoint - request URL (e.g. /appointment/emr )
level - log level (info, debug, warn, error)
message - standard logging message
method - request method (POST, PUT, PATCH, GET, DELETE etc.) partnerId - partner id
requestId- request id (this id will remain the same for a request or a session)
If a request originated from a web app or frontend it would be the same for a request-response session In the case of IVR and Forms, it will remain the same for all requests made during a session
In the case of appointment sync with EMRs, it will remain the same for an entity sync
for more details please check this page - Improved traceability of a request across the microservices
scope - It will show the file name where the log is added (e.g. scope: "[api:services/appointment/AppointmentMgmtService]" ) serviceName - This will show the service name where the log is added (e.g serviceName: "appointment-service" )
How to search the logs with the help of new logging parameters
we can use these parameters for log filters in the log explorer query and run it
The query will look like this
jsonPayload.requestId = "82226b33-c6f3-4900-9964-b3ebb7921731" jsonPayload.method = "GET"
jsonPayload.partnerId = "119"
jsonPayload.serviceName = "appointment-service" jsonPayload.endpoint = "/appointment"

1 Problem description
i It is important to, before we jump to solutions, fully describe the problem we are trying to solve. This will help us to keep the problem in
mind throughout the process and ensure we're actually solving the original problem.
2 Proposed value
i If we solve this problem, what value does it bring to Phelix? This will help us to prioritise this value alongside other initiatives.
3 Proposed solution
i What solution (if any) are you proposing to resolve this problem? Give a very high-level overview. Also, complete the questionarre to
ensure the proposed solution aligns to our Phelix Values.
☞ Value alignment
What positive impact does this initiative have on our merchants? Does this have any negative impact on their businesses or the overall customer
experience of our ecosystem?
Is the proposed solution of a high quality? Given the scope and constraints of the initiative, are we adequately catering to our technical and design principles?
Does the proposed solution introduce any unnecessary complexity for stakeholders or users?
Are the goals for this initiative simple and clear? Is our solution at all bloated with unnecessary work or untested assumptions?
4 Alternative solutions
i List some alternative solutions to this problem. They may be less ideal but mostly get the job done. It's important to list these both so we
know we've considered our options and so we have a backup plan if things do not go well.
1. Try to market the existing OneSaaS integration to determine this feasibility.
Could be a non-starter because feedback so far has been disappointing and OneSaaS is at times unreliable.
2. Integrate with BigCommerce via Cresco
Want to avoid this if possible because of high costs and the unreliability of Cresco.
5 Scope
i Articulate what is in scope, and what is not. It is important to ensure everyone is on the same page about how big this is and how much
we want to invest. Your answer here may change as the initiative is discussed with others.
In scope: first-party integration with BigCommerce outside of our monolith.
Out of scope: changing any other parts of our system/any work that requires other teams to get involved.
6 Dependencies
i List out which external people or teams are implicated by this problem and/or solution.
1302

 This project will require collaboration with sales and marketing as we will need to determine how to market the experimental solution to prospects and how to on-board them.

 Virtual Waiting Room - EMR (Oscar/Accuro) Case Appointment Sync (assumption is that its working)
Referral Added in Phelix
A referral is added in Phelix. This referral will get synced with the patient records in Oscar. The assumption is that this is already working.
Once the referral for a patient is in Oscar, then the clinic admin will schedule appointments for that patient in Oscar. So once a clinic admin sets up an appointment then that appointment gets added in Phelix as well.
We should be able to see that appointment in Day list as well as in the patient chart under a referral id. To attach it to a referral we need figure out the patient for which the appointment is booked in Oscar and then come to Phelix search for that patient. See all the Active Referrals for that patient and attach the appointment to the most recent Active Referral. The assumption here is that this is also working. If not working then this needs to work like this.
No referral in Phelix but appointment booked in Oscar
Some times there may not be any referral added in Phelix. The appointment is directly booked in Oscar for a given patient. In this case we need to sync the appointment in the day list. Also if the patient does not exist then we create the patient in Phelix. But the appointment in this case will only appear in day list as we do not have any referral id to tie this appointment in the patient chart. The assumption here is that this is also working.
Referral added in Phelix and appointment booked in Phelix
In this case the referral was added in Phelix and also the appointment was booked in Phelix. Here we need to update Oscar on both events when referral is added and when appointment is booked. The appointment should appear in our day list and should have a confirmed status in Oscar. Again the assumption is that this is working.
Appointment creation in Phelix is driven by these status mapping in Phelix:
Day List workflow:
Once an appointment is in our Day List it will be most of the times controlled by the clinic admin in Oscar and in Phelix we need to mimic the changes based on status provided by Oscar Sync Job.
1. Appointment in Oscar is tied to an Assigned Physician. So in Day list we need to add a column called “Assign Physician” that displays the physician name that is being shared by Oscar as part of the appointment. It comes under the name ‘Provider’
2. So on Day list the clinic admin will see all appointments for that day arranged in order of earliest first and latest last. An appointment at 9 am should show before an appointment at 5 pm.
3. In day list we should show all appointments in Oscar that are having status as ‘To Do’ ‘Daysheet Printed’ ‘Picked’ ‘Confirmed’
 1305

  4. In day list continue to show the Filters All, Rooms and Physicians and the bubbles. they should continue to work as is today.
5. When the value is selected as Rooms then show the bubbles for all Rooms and when the value is selected as Physicians then show bubbles for all physicians. Once we click on a bubble then only show those appointments in the Day list that either are assigned to that room or that physician. Although in Oscar case you will have only Physicians assigned to an appointment. The room will most times be NA
6. Also in Day List only allow the clinic admin to select multiple bubbles. Once multiple bubbles are selected the concept of rows might also come in. Where in each selected bubble turns into a row and and then shows all the appointments within. @Rishab Agrawal let's discuss this through.
7. In Day List view show at-least 50 appointments on one page. At present we are showing only 10.
Virtual Waiting Room (VWR) Flow:
Once an appointment appears in the Day List the next step for that appointment is the Virtual Waiting Room. This is most likely going to be controlled by Phelix.
1. The clinic admin sees an appointment in the Day list and clicks on Check in. This appointment should now move to the Virtual Waiting Room and we should update the status in Oscar As “Here” ( for the appointment). Basically, the status that we sync back to the EMR is whatever is mapped on our side. In our case (able care) its mapped as 'H'.
2. Another way is that in Oscar the clinic admin updates the status for the appointment as “Here” in Oscar then we need to automatically check-in the patient and move to VWR in Phelix.
3. The clinic admin comes to VWR and then sees all the appointments that are checked-in from the Day List in Phelix arranged in the order of the time they were checked in. The earliest one to be checked in shown at the top and the last one to be checked in shown at the bottom.
4. Show at-least 50 appointments on a single page.
5. Remove this filter view from VWR screen
  1306

  Queue Type is By Location
1. Accordingly all appointments are given a position in the queue for that Location. “By Location” is the default setting of queue type.
2. If the queue type is set as “By Location” then do not show the bubbles for room and physician on the the Virtual Waiting Room screen.
3. By Location to have its own queue, where the position in queue is determined by the time of check-in and also the clinic admin has the ability to move an appointment up or down in position by clicking on the up and down arrows.
4. In the VWR screen we also need another column for “Assigned Physician” that is basically ‘Provider’ in the appointment synced from Phelix.
5. Also, show at-least 50 appointments on a single page on VWR as well.
6. There is another bug that we need to solve. Currently we are only able to move an appointment up or down in queue on the same page.
For example, if we are on the second page then an appointment can move up to the first position on the second page only. It does not go all the way to the first page. We need it to move along the queue irrespective of what page we show it on.
Queue type is By Rooms
7. Now the queue type for VWR can also be set by rooms. Here the clinic admin comes to the Provider SMS settings and selects queue type as By Rooms. Here we only Need to select the queue type By Rooms. We can get rid of the drop down where we select individual rooms. So we do not need the field for Select Rooms.
   1307

  8. If the clinic admin selects By Rooms as queue type and saves then on the VWR there is now a queue that is organized with the room type. All rooms will now have their own queue. So Room 1 will have their own Position 1 and 10 and Room 2 will have their own position 1 and 10.
9. Once the queue type is selected as By Rooms, then we see all the bubbles on the VWR screen for rooms only (not physician).
10. Once the clinic admin clicks on a Bubble then they see the queue appointments for that particular room only. They can still move it up and down but it moves the position in the queue for that particular room.
11. If no bubble is selected then the screen will not show any appointment as there is no queue.
12. Show an additional bubble for NA. This is the case of appointments where a room is not assigned.
Queue type is By Physician
13. Now the queue type for VWR can also be set By Physician. Here the clinic admin comes to the Provider SMS settings and selects queue type as By Physicians. Here we only Need to select the queue type By Physicians. We can get rid of the drop down where we select individual physician. So we do not need the field for Select Physician.
  14. If the clinic admin selects By Physicians and saves then on the VWR there is now a queue that is organized with the physician type. All physicians will now have their own queue. So Dr Kiet will have their own Position 1 and 10 and Dr Sujit will have their own position 1 and 10.
15. Once the queue type is selected as By Physicians, then we see all the bubbles on the VWR screen for Physicians only (not rooms).
16. Once the clinic admin clicks on a Bubble then they see the queue of appointments for that particular physician only. They can still move it up and down but it moves the position for a particular Physician queue.
17. If no bubble is selected then the screen will not show any appointment as there is no queue.
18. Show an additional bubble for NA. This is the case of appointments where a physicians is not assigned.
 1308

 VWR messages
The messages being sent out to the patient are being controlled form the VWR messages settings.
1. Once the patient is checked in the there is a toggle for sending message or not. If the toggle is off then do not send any message on check-in (moving to VWR). But if its turned on then the clinic admin has to select the message type from the dropdown. This was working before and we should go back t how it was. The change we made recently is not required. However we can rename “Selected Location Messages Settings” to “Send Message when Checked-in”
2. The messages that get sent out based on your position in queue should continue to work as is. No change required.
Moving to In-Room
1. When clinic admin clicks on 'Move to Room' then we ask which room do they need to be assigned to.
  1309

  2. Once clinic admin selects a room and saves then in Phelix we need to move the patient out of VWR and IN room tab. This should enter a value for Entered Room time and also the In Room Time timer should start.
3. Once a patient is moved into a room then if the WayFinding setting is turned on for that account a message needs to go out to the patient. This message is what is saved as part of the room details in WayFinding Instructions.
4. Once a patient has been moved to In Room in Phelix then we need to sync the appropriate appointment status in Oscar by passing the EMR code for that room to the appointment (t2 in above image). This should update the status in Oscar to the appropriate value like “Room 1” or “Customized 2” etc base don what room the patient is assigned to and what EMR code is passed.
   1310

  5. Similarly, for a patient in VWR the clinic admin can directly update the status in Oscar to “Room 1” or “Customized 2” etc. In this case our appointment sync job will fetch the EMR code for that room and we need to move the patient In Room automatically to the room mapped with the appropriate EMR code. This should also send out a message as per the room details. This should also enter a value for Entered Room time and also the In Room Time timer should start.
6. An edge case scenario may exist there may be a room inOscar that does not exisit in Phelix then if the clinic admin updates the status to that room then we do not know where to map the patient to as the EMR code is not present in Phelix. Vice-versa a room maybe present in Phelix and not in EMR and if clinic admin moves the patient to that room then what do we update the status to in Oscar. @Hassaan Ahmed toprovideclarification.
Clear Room
1. Once the clinic admin clicks on Clear room in Phelix then the appointment is marked as over/completed (cleared room). Question is what status to pass over to Oscar when appointment is over.
As per Hassaan this is out of scope.
2. Similarly, a clinic admin can mark an appointment as Completed/Over in Oscar and then in Phelix we need to Clear Room for that patient. How do we do this?
As per Hassaan, once we move the patient to IN Room by listening the the room EMR code then we Clear Room once we get a status code that is not mapped to any other Room EMR code on Phelix. Example, suppose we got “a” form Oscar and moved the patient to Room 1. Now we get a another status as “Z”. We check if “Z” is mapped to any room EMR code on Phelix. If we do not have any room with EMR Room code as “Z” then we clear the room.
3. Another edge case can come when a patient is In Room for Room 1 but we get a status code from Oscar that is EMR room code for a different room in Phelix then we shift the patient appointment to a different room For Example, suppose we got “a” form Oscar and moved the patient to Room 1. Now we get a another status as “Z”. We check if “Z” is mapped to any room EMR code on Phelix. If we find that “Z” is mapped to EMR Room code for Room 3 in Phelix then we shift the patient to Room 3. Post this if we get a code that is not mapped to any EMR room code in Phelix then we clear the room.

 Invoice Generation and Management - Akumin case
When a referral is added in Phelix it eventually needs to be billed and paid for either by the insurer or by the patient in full or in part (co-pay). Each referral must have an invoice attached to it. The most recent added referral invoice will be displayed on top of the list and always in expanded view. The earlier referrals invoice will be collapsed and below the most recent added referral The order is based on the referral being added in Phelix. Most recent on top and oldest at the bottom. There are two ways in which Phelix can generate an Invoice.
 1. Estimation Source is Waystar
When a referral is added in Phelix, we make a call to Waystar to fetch the insurance details. Now this response returns us many fields but for invoice purposes we are interested in two fields, Patient Financial Responsibility and Procedure Allowed amount. We need to have this listening and updating dynamically. Suppose we call waystar and the eligibility fails, then the clinic admin or patient updates their insurance details and clicks on Recheck. Now we get new call details from Waystar so we need to update the invoice details as well. Discussed in more detail sections below.
When we generate an Invoice with estimation Source as Waystar It should have the below items mentioned:
a. Invoice Id - System generated
b. Referral id - as per the referral
c. Procedures - Each procedure is a row in the the invoice. Including the ones added post a referral was added as well as any Add-Ons
(contrast).
d. Estimation Source: “Waystar” when populating the invoice by listening to the Waystar response.
e. Procedure Allowed Amount: Returned from the Waystar response and populated as-is. Not editable field.
f. Patient Paid: This field is what we populate once an invoice has been paid but for now it will always be blank if estimation source is Waystar. This is also not editable.
g. Patient Financial Responsibility (procedure level): If the estimation source is Waystar then patient financial responsibility is also blank against individual procedures.
h. Payment Status: Will be Unpaid and will turn to Paid once we get a successful response from Imagine Pay for a successful transaction.
i. Estimation Generation Source: Will be Waystar. Need to add an icon for “switch”. The functionality of it is detailed below.
j. Patient Financial responsibility (referral level): We don't get a PFR against individual procedure but we get what the patient needs to
pay for an overall referral. This is what we will display here. It will be uneditable.
k. Payment Date: Will be blank at the beginning and will only display a value once the payment has been made on Imagine Pay.
l. Total Amount: Initially this will display the Patient Financial Responsibility and is allowed to edit by the clinic admin.
  2Ei i iSlfP Di

2. Estimation source is Self Pay Directory: a. Invoice Id - System generated
b. Referral id - as per the referral
c. Procedures - Each procedure is a row in the the invoice. Including the ones added post a referral was added as well as any Add-Ons (contrast).
d. Estimation Source: “Self Pay Directory” when populating the invoice by fetching the values for the CPT from our self pay directory
e. Procedure Allowed Amount: Will be 0. As this is Self pay case.
f. Patient Paid: This field is what we populate once an invoice has been paid but for now it will always be blank if estimation source is Self Pay This is also not editable.
g. Patient Financial Responsibility (procedure level): In the case of estimation source being ‘Self Pay Directory’ the PFR at procedure level will be what is returned from the directory for the procedure. If the procedure returns 0 or blank then display as is.
h. Payment Status: Will be Unpaid and will turn to Paid once we get a successful response from Imagine Pay for a successful transaction.
i. Estimation Generation Source: Will be Self Pay Directory. Need to add an icon for “switch”. The functionality of it is detailed below.
j. Patient Financial responsibility (referral level): This will be the total of all the patient financial responsibility for all the procedures fetched from the Self Pay Directory.
k. Payment Date: Will be blank at the beginning and will only display a value once the payment has been made on Imagine Pay.
l. Total Amount: Initially this will display the Patient Financial Responsibility and is allowed to edit by the clinic admin.
What is Active (default) Invoice:
Active Invoice is the flag that is set against an invoice in the backend to display in the UI and for the form builder to fetch the invoice data (total amount) for making payment.
If eligibility is True then invoice with estimation source Waystar is Active. If eligibility is false the invoice with Self Pay is Active.
If from the UI the clinic admin switches from Waystar to Self Pay then Self Pay is active and vice versa. If from SelfPay clinic admin switches to Waystar then Waystar is Active.
The form builder, Capture Payment and Send Invoice will always use the Active Invoice data to send to Imagine pay for payment.
User Journey 1: Referral is added in Phelix and Eligibility is True.
Clinic admin processes a referral and its added in Referral received. Generate an Invoice id against that referral id
For the same invoice id, generate two invoices in the backend. One with Estimation source as Waystar and one with estimation source as Self pay.
At first when we generate with Waystar the call most of the times comes back as False and then it moves to Incomplete and then it
again makes a call wherein it comes back as Eligibility = True.
So at first the Invoice with Waystar as estimation source will have no values fetched and populated from the response. But it should populate once we get eligibility=true and some data in call back from Waystar.
So of the two invoices we generate with estimation source as Waystar and Self Pay Directory, Waystar is always default if Eligibility = True. If Eligibility = False then Self Pay Directory is the default. Meaning on the UI we render the invoice with estimation source = Waystar if eligibility is true and if eligibility is false then we render the estimation source = self pay. In implementation this might mean setting up an active flag against one version of the invoices.
In this case eligibility = true so the default invoice is one with estimation source as Waystar.
The clinic admin clicks on Invoice and sees the Invoice with Estimation source as Waystar on the UI.
The clinic admin sees the total amount as fetched from the Patient Financial responsibility from the Waystar call back. The form builder team picks up the total amount from the active invoice.
User Journey 2: Referral is added in Phelix and Eligibility is False
 Clinic admin processes a referral and its added in Referral received.
1313

 Generate an Invoice id against that referral id
For the same invoice id, generate two invoices in the backend. One with Estimation source as Waystar and one with estimation source as Self pay.
Since Eligibility is False the invoice with Waystar as estimation source will have null values.
In this case the invoice generated with Self Pay Direcotory is to be treated a default and rendered on the UI.
The clinic admin clicks on Invoice and sees the Invoice with Estimation source as Self Pay on the UI.
Each procedure to mention the Patient financial responsibility which is fetched from the self pay directory.
The total amount and the patient financial responsibility at the referral level will be the sum of all PFR obtained at procedure level. The form builder team picks up the total amount from the active invoice.
User Journey 3: Patient is paying the invoice on the form builder side
The patient receives the booking form and in this one of the steps is where they pay the invoice.
When the form builder is rendering the invoice to the patient then it always picks up the details from the invoice that is flagged as Active. For any referral we will have 2 invoices, Estimation source as Waystar and Estimation Source as Self Pay. However, only one of them will be Active.
Once the patient pays for the Active invoice, then we get transaction Success from Imagine pay. At this point update the status of the Active Invoice as Paid.
Add a time line event. Event Type = Invoice, Event = Invoice Paid
User Journey 4: Clinic admin wants to switch between the two invoices
Against the value of Estimation Source (in the summary section) we show an Icon that will allow the clinic admin to switch between the two invoices.
If Eligibility is True then the Waystar Invoice is rendered as default. However the clinic admin can click on the Icon against the Estimation source to switch to Invoice with estimation source as Self Pay.
Once this happens then make the default (active flag) invoice as Self pay.
Also make an entry in timeline. Even Type= Invoice, Event = Estimation source changed.
Similarly, if Eligibility is False then the Active (default) Invoice is Self Pay. However the clinic admin can still switch the invoice to Estimation source as Waystar. Again log a timeline event.
User Journey 5: Clinic admin edits the total amount
In both invoices the clinic admin can edit the total amount and that becomes the final amount that the patient needs to pay and we need to pass to Imagine pay and Imagine Billing.
The clinic Admin will click on the Edit icon against the total amount in the summary section.
A pop-up will open up where the clinic admin will enter a value and Save or Cancel.
The new value will now become the Total Invoice value of the invoice. This will have no impact on Patient financial Responsibility at the procedure level or the referral (summary) level.
Add a timeline even whenever the Total amount is edited. Event Type= Invoice, Event = Total amount changed.
User Journey 6: Clinic Admin wants to add an Overdue amount
A patient might have some amount that the clinic admin might want to charge that is outside the invoice.
For this they will click on the Add Overdue button. Then they will see a pop-up where they need to mandatorily enter a Reason and Amount.
Once added (saved) there will now be another row entry (line item like procedures).
The Reason will be displayed under the column for Procedures and the amount will be displayed under the Patient Financial responsibility column.
The amount added as overdue will add to the total amount of the invoice.
No negative values allowed. Any value greater than 0 is allowed. Even decimal.
 1314

 Add a timeline event. Event type = Invoice, Event = Overdue amount added
User Journey 7: Clinic Admin wants to add a Refund
A patient might have some amount that the clinic admin might want to refund that is outside the invoice.
For this they will click on the Add Refund button. Then they will see a pop-up where they need to mandatorily enter a Reason and Amount.
Once added (saved) there will now be another row entry (line item like procedures).
The Reason will be displayed under the column for Procedures and the amount will be displayed under the Patient Paid column. The amount added as refund will subtract from the total amount of the invoice.
No negative values allowed. Any value greater than 0 is allowed. Even decimal.
Add a timeline event. Event type = Invoice, Event = Refund amount added
User Journey 8: Send Invoice payment link to patient
A clinic admin will click on the Send Invoice button and this will trigger a check point. This check point will then send a message to the patient phone number.
The message will contain a payment form link which the patient will click an be directed to Imagine pay payment page. The amount that is shown on the payment page is for the Active Invoice i.e The invoice that is shown on the UI.
The patient makes the payment then update the Invoice status for the active invoice as Paid.
Add a time line event. Event Type = Invoice, Event = Invoice Paid
User Journey 9: Capture Payment on behalf of the patient
A clinic admin will click on the Capture Payment button and this will open the Imagine pay payment page on a new tab. The amount that is shown on the payment page is for the Active Invoice i.e The invoice that is shown on the UI.
The patient makes the payment then update the Invoice status for the active invoice as Paid.
Add a time line event. Event Type = Invoice, Event = Invoice Paid
User Journey 10: Post payment freeze the Invoice
Once an invoice has been paid either in the booking form or by the Send Invoice or Capture Payment function then do not allow the clinic admin to edit the invoice any further.
Remove all Edit icons. Remove the icon for switching the Estimation source. Remove or disable Add Overdue or Add Refund Buttons.
Remove or disable Capture Payment or Send Invoice Buttons.
User Journey 11: Download the invoice
Once clinic admin clicks on the download button then download a Pdf in their browser. The name fo the file is <InvoiceID>_<ReferralID>.pdf
The pdf will have no Edit icons, no buttons, no estimation source switch icon. Otherwise all the other information on the pdf will be as displayed on our UI.
User Journey 11: Print the invoice
Once the Clinic admin clicks on Print Invoice then render the same file for printing that is generated for download invoice. The name fo the file is <InvoiceID>_<ReferralID>.pdf
The pdf will have no Edit icons, no buttons, no estimation source switch icon.
Otherwise all the other information on the pdf will be as displayed on our UI.

 Unified Search
We have two scenarios for search. One where the consumer is okay to show multiple matches to the end user and the other is when the consumer is not okay to show multiple matches to the end user.
For example, in fax inbox we can show multiple matches to the end user but the form builder and IVR cannot show multiple matches, here we need to show exact match.
There are three ways to search:
1. In Phelix
2. In EMR
3. In MPI (Master Patient Index - Akumin case)
We should have a config at each partner level that will control the search behaviour.
If “In Phelix” is turned on then search only in Phelix. If EMR is turned on then search in EMR
If MPI is turned on then search in MPI.
Steps for Search flow:
If patient id is entered (eg: Search bar) then search in Phelix.
Now in patient parameters the first parameter to search by is HCN (Health Card No). If consumer is okay to display multiple results (fax inbox) then return multiple matches and the user will manually select one out of the list. If the consumer wants an exact match like form builder and IVR then return only exact (single) match. If single match not found then go the below step.
If HCN is not available or multiple matches are found then search via phone number. Here again if it is okay for the consumer to show multiple matches then show otherwise return results only for exact (single) match. If single match not found then go the below step.
If both HCN and Phone numer are not available or fail to return an exact match then use the patient First Name, Last Name and Date of Birth combination. All three factors should exactly match. And the first name and Last name use only the first words to find the search. Some people enter middle name as well with either first name or last name so we will always try and return with the first word entered in both fields for First name and last name. Again, if consumer is okay with showing multiple matches then show otherwise only show exact match. If single match not found then go the below step.
If from all the above three steps we are not able to find a single match then fail the search and create the patient in phelix and then sync with EMR and MPI.
Steps to be taken on the consumer side:
A consumer is responsible for passing patient details
Consumer will also indicate whether they are okay with publishing multiple matches or want exact match only. Publishing of search result and allowing the user to select are consumer responsibilities.
The Below has already been implemented: MX Patient ID
- Search in Phelix HCN
- Search in Phelix
- Search in EMR All param
- Search in Phelix - Search in EMR
- Phone Number - Find phone from any of 3 ( Work, Home, Cell )
1317

 - First Name, Last Name ( Both should match )
- Name ( Like Partial or Full match in First or last name)

 Dialpad
Dialpad Features in Use:
During this meeting, Chivers showed us the Dialpad features they currently use. Please see below for a brief description:
Queue Management
The user has the ability to choose how many people can be in the queue at a time.
The user has the ability to choose how long individuals can stay in the queue and after that time limit has passed, which fallback option will be used.
Fallback options include voicemail, a custom message, and another department’s line. User experience
The user has the ability to choose the hold music, ring duration, welcome message, and voicemail message. Call Management
The user has the ability to choose which operator lines will receive calls in what order.
Line status (active/do not disturb) is a criteria for call forwarding and the user has the ability to choose to whom the call will forward if all lines are on “Do Not Disturb” status. These calls can also be forwarded to the Call Centre.
The user has the ability to decide operating hours including choosing both holidays and office hours. For calls outside of these hours, the user can choose a closed message.
The user can record all calls and block any phone number/ spam calls. Automated IVR
The user has the ability to create an automated main menu allowing the caller to self direct to a location of their need. Call Centre
The user is provided analytics for the call centre including: Handled calls, total minutes, missed calls, abandoned calls, call volume, average call duration, agent status, number of live calls, service level (what percentage of calls were answered within a certain amount of time), speed to answer and abandon rate.
The user can also see more detailed analytics for each call centre operator including: Inbound minutes, total, ACD, textx, missed,
outbound, wrap-up time, idle time. Within these analytics the user can also see call specific analytics as well. Miscellaneous
The user has the ability to select an email address to which voicemails will be sent.
IVR Integration APIs:
When looking into the API documentation to see what can be done for IVR integration, the following conclusions were drawn:
We can determine which operators have been inputted for a specific department as well as their status (active/do not
disturb) https://dialpad.com/api/v2/departments/{id}/operators . In addition, we can see if all operators are busy where the call should be forwarded https://dialpad.com/api/v2/departments/{id} . We are less familiar with the logic implemented that dictates which operator should be forwarded to in what order, so am unable to say for certain we can GET that information as needed.

 Sample Initiative
Before starting a project, it is important to document the problem we are trying to solve and the outcomes we are hoping to achieve. This allows us to ensure everyone stays on the same page throughout the process and that we do not over/under-invest in solving problems.
 When writing up initiatives, we usually use the following template. Initiatives are documented either in a Jira Task/Epic, or a dedicated Confluence page in cases where significant documentation is required or an initiative encompasses multiple epics.
Initiative Template
1 Problem description
i It is important to, before we jump to solutions, fully describe the problem we are trying to solve. This will help us to keep the problem in
mind throughout the process and ensure we're actually solving the original problem.
1. The addressable market of our backend retail management solution is heavily restricted by the requirement to adopt our shopping cart, which in the future will be only one of the many sales channels that merchants require.
2. We do not know if our platform can be competitive in the WMS space.
2 Proposed value
i If we solve this problem, what value does it bring to Phelix? This will help us to prioritise this value alongside other initiatives.
1. If we can prove that our platform can truly become the Shopify of the warehouse, we can significantly clarify our vision for the product and wider business.
2. If we can expand our addressable market in the short-term by partnering with another shopping cart platform, we can grow Phelix more quickly.
1355

 3 Proposed solution
i What solution (if any) are you proposing to resolve this problem? Give a very high-level overview. Also, complete the questionarre to
ensure the proposed solution aligns to our Phelix Values.
The Kraken team will focus on building a connector between Phelix and BigCommerce for merchants to use Phelix for fulfilment and inventory management as an experiment.
☞ Value alignment
What positive impact does this initiative have on our merchants? Does this have any negative impact on their businesses or the overall customer
experience of our ecosystem?
This initiative will allow us to clarify our plans for the future. It will tell us whether we can focus more on the issues the customers who are outgrowing us are having (WMS-related) or whether we need to double down on our shopping cart. If this initiative leads us to eventually move away from having our own shopping cart, this could be a painful change for some merchants but should ultimately result in them having access to a better shopping cart than they do today.
Is the proposed solution of a high quality? Given the scope and constraints of the initiative, are we adequately catering to our technical and design principles?
We will be taking the opportunity to build this new integration entirely outside of our existing monolith, enabling us to embrace our technical principles to a greater extent than ever before.
Does the proposed solution introduce any unnecessary complexity for stakeholders or users?
This will ultimately help us to reduce complexity as this gives us a pathway towards once again owning the technology behind all of our sales channel integrations. The current situation with Cresco Data/OneSaaS has introduced a large amount of complexity for both stakeholders and users, which this project will help us to eventually eliminate.
Are the goals for this initiative simple and clear? Is our solution at all bloated with unnecessary work or untested assumptions?
The scope of this initiative is to test our technical approach towards this type of integration. We’ve been careful to exclude any features that we’re unsure will be necessary.
4 Alternative solutions
i List some alternative solutions to this problem. They may be less ideal but mostly get the job done. It's important to list these both so we
know we've considered our options and so we have a backup plan if things do not go well.
1. Try to market the existing OneSaaS integration to determine this feasibility.
Could be a non-starter because feedback so far has been disappointing and OneSaaS is at times unreliable.
2. Integrate with BigCommerce via Cresco
Want to avoid this if possible because of high costs and the unreliability of Cresco.
5 Scope
i Articulate what is in scope, and what is not. It is important to ensure everyone is on the same page about how big this is and how much
we want to invest. Your answer here may change as the initiative is discussed with others.
In scope: first-party integration with BigCommerce outside of our monolith.
Out of scope: changing any other parts of our system/any work that requires other teams to get involved.
6 Dependencies
i List out which external people or teams are implicated by this problem and/or solution.
This project will require collaboration with sales and marketing as we will need to determine how to market the experimental solution to prospects and how to on-board them.
1356

 7 Success Criteria
i What measures, if any, will help us to define success? X customers by Y.

  NDA Guidelines
A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between two or more parties. The parties signing the agreement agree that sensitive information they may obtain will not be made available to any others.
Please keep in mind that protecting our customers and partners’ confidential information and complying with our confidentiality obligations is critical to our business.
When do I need an NDA?
You need an NDA if you are entering into discussions regarding a potential business transaction and anticipate disclosing or receiving information that we consider confidential, or if the other party requires one. An NDA will be required in most sales discussions that proceed beyond the first introductory meeting. This enables us and the prospective customer or partner to exchange information comfortably.
Examples of confidential information may include:
trade secrets
financial information, including pricing
technical information
business or product information
the terms of any agreement, including any related negotiations and proposals.
An NDA helps to remind the parties that these things are confidential—even the very existence of the discussions.
Please remember that the NDA is to protect confidentiality only. A subsequent agreement needs to be in place prior in order for us to enter into a transaction or arrangement with a partner, customer, independent contractor or any other party.
For general (and most ) purposes, you can send the other party our standard Phelix Commercial NDA (in PDF). If any custom development is being considered, please reach out to sara@ so we can put a Developer NDA in place to protect our intellectual property.
Where can I find Phelix’s standard NDA ?
You can access our standard commercial NDA on the share drive here, or attached to this Confluence page. When sending this NDA, please ensure you send a PDF version and do not make any changes to the document. If the other party requests any changes, please reach out to sara@ for help.
Once the other party has signed the NDA you sent them, please forward this to sara@ for countersignature.
How many NDAs do I need with the other party?
We only need one NDA signed by an authorized signatory for the other party. This binds the entity, including its employees.
When there are multiple people from the same party to work with, there’s no need to ask each person to sign - we only need one NDA per organization.
  1370

 I’m working on a project with two companies and all three of us need to collaborate. Do I need a new NDA that covers this or can I proceed as long as Phelix has NDAs already with both companies?
We need to have permission to share each party’s information with the other party as a part of collaborating. If all 3 parties need to have conversations together related to a specific purpose, we need to get a 3-way NDA in place so that each party authorizes the sharing of information between the parties. If that is what you need to do in this case, please reach out to sara@phelix.ai.
Do we need a new NDA if the other party signatory has left that company?
No, as long as the signatory signed on behalf of the company (and not in their own personal capacity) then the signatory implied their authority to bind the company at the time by signing/accepting the NDA. The NDA is on behalf of the company, so it doesn't matter if the employee is there any longer or not.
With whom can I share the other party’s confidential information?
If you have received confidential information from another party, you must treat that information with the same degree of care as we treat our own confidential information. In most cases, you can share the other party’s confidential information with other Phelix employees and our contractors as long as they have a need to know such information to assist with the purpose of that NDA (unless restrictive conditions have been put in place). If you’re unsure, reach out to sara@phelix.ai for guidance.
Does our standard NDA expire?
No, our standard form does not expire and is effective until terminated. There is a reference to years in the NDA actually but this refers to the confidentiality obligation (i.e., time that information should be kept confidential from each date of disclosure).
Should I still limit my conversations even after signing an NDA?
An NDA is only as good as each party is trustworthy. Share only as much information as is necessary for the scope of your conversations.
For research and development discussions, keep in mind that an NDA does not cover ownership of any new ideas or inventions created during the discussions. So, if you are talking to a company about potential development efforts, always try to limit your discussions to our general capabilities and what they want done, but do not discuss how we will do it. When conversations evolve into how things will be implemented or made, then new ideas and inventions may be created. Without an agreement that covers ownership of intellectual property rights, we may lose ownership of ideas and inventions that we would otherwise want to own, so it is safer to hold those parts of the discussion until after the appropriate agreement is signed. If any development is being discussed with the other party, we will need to put in place a developer NDA so please reach out to sara@phelix.ai. This is the case even if the other party has already signed a commercial NDA with us - It is okay to have both NDA types on file because they contain different purposes and can live side-by-side to be used for different types of conversations.
What’s the difference between Commercial and Development?
The Commercial NDA is used for general discussions about a potential business transaction or business relationship. The Development NDA is different in that it contains a purpose of facilitating technical discussions concerning existing or future product development efforts and has one extra clause – a residuals clause (explained in more detail below).
Use the Development NDA where you anticipate receiving information regarding technical concepts or proprietary information that may overlap with current or future development efforts at Phelix.
What exactly is the “residuals” clause in the Development NDA?
A “residual” is something that you remember from talking with another party or viewing their written confidential information without purposefully trying to memorize it. The residuals clause in the Development NDA says that either party may develop or purchase products similar to what is being discussed, but neither party gains any intellectual property rights to the other party’s information except for the limited right of using it for the purpose identified in the NDA (usually to decide whether or not to do business).
      1371

 When we are engaged to design or develop something for a customer/partner (including an integration or proof of concept), we want to ensure that our engineers can continue development with other parties. If an engineer solves a design problem, part of the solution may touch on something inadvertently remembered from early conversations with a party. If we later decide to work with another party, we do not want to be accused of misappropriating trade secrets of the first party or unfair business practices.
Note, this clause is only intended to protect Phelix with respect to information inadvertently remembered that we cannot attach to a particular person or place in our memories. If you do remember the information as belonging to a particular party with which we have signed an NDA, then be careful to treat it as confidential information. Also, this clause does not give us a license to that information. So, if the other party had a patent on it, we would need to get a license to use it.
What if the other party proposes changes to the standard NDA language or if they insist on using their form?
Please pass this along to sara@phelix.ai for review. Other party information
How am I supposed to know the other party’s full legal entity name?
Please confirm the full legal name of the other party with your contact there (example: ABCDE LLC, ABCDE Limited, ABCDE Ltd.) prior to sending the NDA to ensure the NDA is signed without being sent back for correction.
What if it’s an NDA with an individual (not a company)?
Please reach out to for help !

We expect all of our employees, officers, contractors, consultants, interns, advisors and board members to know, understand and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment or relationship with Phelix. To achieve optimal legal and ethical behavior, you must know and understand the Code as it applies to you and as it applies to others. Most importantly, you must comply with the Code. You are required to attend any Code of Conduct training mandated by Phelix in order to make sure everyone understands how to remain compliant.
No Retaliation
Phelix prohibits retaliation against any worker who, in good faith, reports or participates in an investigation of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or the law. No retaliation will be taken against you for reporting alleged violations while acting in good faith.
Reporting a Violation
You are the Phelix’s first line of defense against civil or criminal liability and unethical business practices. You must report any violation or suspected violation of this Code of Conduct, applicable laws and/or governmental regulations. If you observe or become aware of conduct that appears to be contrary to this Code, you must immediately report the situation directly to people-ops@phelix.ai or a member of the leadership team. Team leads or managers who receive any report of a suspected violation must report the matter to sara@phelix.ai.
Treating Our Customers and their Data Respectfully
By conducting business in an ethical manner, we honor the opportunity we’ve been afforded to help transform healthcare through our customers and partners. We only succeed when our customers, partners and users derive value from Phelix. Ultimately, we make useful products and tools to help transform healthcare. But our value extends beyond delivering great products - it is also in holding ourselves to a higher standard in how we operate. Following these principles will ensure we maintain that high standard:
  1373

 Respect
Everything we do at Phelix should be based on the respect we have for our customers and users. We deeply respect the opportunity we are given to service our customers. This means that we focus on the customer first and foremost, and everything else follows. Respect should be reflected in every interaction with our customer and in our treatment of every piece of data and information. If at any time you feel our customers aren’t being well-served, let someone in the company know about it. We have a collective responsibility to ensure we are continually improving our products and our customer’s experience with us. Everyone at Phelix is encouraged to champion our customers and to speak up when the interests of our users are at stake.
Trust and Integrity
Our reputation as a company that our customers can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our customers and users should increase their trust in us. You are expected to conduct business activities with integrity and fairness. Every one of our users is trusting us. Never jeopardize that.
Privacy and Security
Always keep in mind that our customers and users are trusting with their most sensitive information, including personal information and patient information. Preserving that trust requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of all information provided to us by our customers. Our security procedures strictly limit access to and use of users’ personal information, and require that each of us take measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access customer/user personal information only as authorized by our Security Policies, our Privacy Policies and applicable data protection laws. Reach out to privacy@phelix.ai if you have questions on implementing these policies in connection with what you do at Phelix.
Timely Responses
Our customers depend on us to run their business and we owe them timely responses and actions. We build on their trust in us and our products by responding in a timely fashion to all communications from our customers, whether questions, problems or compliments. Our success is built on being useful to our customers and providing them with useful products. A key ingredient to being useful and honest is also being responsive. This shows our customers that we recognize when they have a question or feedback, and we do something about it.
Treating Each Other Respectfully
Phelix holds its leadership, employees and contractors to the highest standards of ethics and conduct to maintain a healthy, fun and supportive environment. We are committed to maintaining a respectful and supportive work environment. Everyone is expected to do their part in creating a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination. Our goal is for everyone at Phelix to thrive and have an equal opportunity to be successful and reach their fullest potential. We expect everyone to treat each other with the utmost respect and dignity.
Please read the Employee Handbook which covers in greater detail how we should conduct ourselves at work. Discrimination, harassment and Bullying
Employment and business opportunities at Phelix are based solely upon merit and qualifications directly related to professional competence. We strictly prohibit discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy, marital status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation or any other characteristics protected by law. Discrimination is behaviour in the workplace that results in an individual’s employment being adversely affected due to the individual’s protected status.
Phelix prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form – verbal, physical, sexual or visual. Anyone who is found to have violated this policy is subject to discipline up to and including termination.
 Workplace harassment may include but is not limited to:
1374

 vexatious comments or conduct sexual harassment
bullying
psychological harassment
Sexual harassment may include but is not limited to:
remarks, jokes, innuendoes, or taunting of a sexual nature about a person's body, attire, age or marital status which causes or is intended to cause awkwardness or embarrassment;
the display of pornographic pictures or other offensive material;
comments or conduct made because of an employee's sex, e.g. comments implying sexual unattractiveness;
unwelcome conduct such as leering, touching, patting, or pinching; Workplace bullying is a form of workplace harassment, and includes:
any inappropriate conduct or comment by a person towards a worker that the person knew or reasonably ought to have known would cause that worker to be humiliated or intimidated.
Workplace psychological harassment is a form of workplace harassment, and includes:
any vexatious behaviour in the form of a single or repeated hostile or unwanted conduct, verbal comments, actions or gestures, that affects a person’s dignity, or psychological or physical integrity, and results in a harmful work environment for the employee. A single serious incident of vexatious behaviour that has a lasting harmful effect on an employee may also constitute workplace psychological harassment.
Phelix has a zero tolerance policy towards discrimination, harassment or bullying of any form. “I didn’t mean it,” “it was just a joke” and/or “I was drinking” are not excuses for engaging in inappropriate conduct.
Harassment does not include a reasonable action taken by an employer or supervisor relating to the management and direction of workers or the workplace, including: changes in work assignment and managing performance, including disciplinary actions related to performance, attendance or behavioural problems.
If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone at Phelix, or by a Phelix partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to people-ops@phelix.ai or any member of the Phelix leadership team. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.
Safe Workplace
We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for everyone, and we will not tolerate any level of violence or the threat of violence in the workplace. Under no circumstances should anyone bring a weapon to work. If you become aware of a violation of this policy, you should report it to Phelix leadership immediately. In case of potential violence, contact building security and/or 9-1-1 immediately.
Acting Ethically and Avoiding Conflicts of Interest
Everyone at Phelix has an obligation to do what's best for the company and our customers. We should conduct our work in an honest and ethical manner. You have a business and ethical responsibility to Phelix to avoid any activity or relationship that may interfere, or have the appearance of interfering, with the performance of your work in a professional, loyal, efficient manner to the best of your ability. This includes not engaging in activities that compete with Phelix or compromise its interests. If found to be personally profiting at the expense of the company or with a perceived or actual conflict of interest, you may be subject to disciplinary action.
When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for you, your friends or your family at the expense of Phelix or our customers, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you’re considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated business at the expense of Phelix. If the answer is “yes,” the action you’re considering is likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should avoid it. It’s also important to understand that as circumstances change, a situation that previously didn’t present a conflict of interest may present one.
 1375

 If you are in a business situation that may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, review the situation with your manager or a member of the leadership team.
Here are some guiding principles to help you avoid conflicts of interest:
Avoid making personal investments in companies that are Phelix competitors or business partners when the investment might cause, or
appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm Phelix.
Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions or board seats with Phelix competitors or business partners when your judgment could
be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Phelix. You should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company.
Business opportunities discovered through your work here belong first to Phelix, except as otherwise agreed to by Phelix.
Developing or helping to develop outside inventions that a) relate to Phelix’s existing or reasonably anticipated products and services, b) relate to your position at Phelix, or c) are developed using Phelix resources likely create conflicts of interest and are subject to the provisions of your employment agreement.
Accepting or soliciting valuable gifts, entertainment, special favors or other considerations from a Phelix, customer, partner, supplier, or competitor is not permitted.
If you become involved in a situation where your interests and those of the company conflict, you must inform and receive written approval from sara@phelix.ai.
Competition Against Phelix
An obvious conflict of interest is providing assistance to an organization, with or without compensation, that markets products or services in competition with the Phelix’s current or potential offerings. During your employment with the Phelix, you may not advise, assist, or work for any such organization, whether as an employee, volunteer, intern, consultant, or a member of such organization’s board of directors. Such activities are prohibited because they divide your loyalty between Phelix and the competing organization.
Use of Phelix Products and Services
Avoiding potential conflicts of interest also means that you should not use Phelix products, services, internal tools, or information in a way other than to perform your role. You may not use Phelix property, such as devices and information, for your personal purposes or benefit.
Confidentiality Obligations
In the course of your employment with or providing services to Phelix, you may have access to Phelix’s Proprietary Information and Confidential Information.
Proprietary Information is company information not known outside Phelix that may have intrinsic value or that may provide the Company with a competitive advantage. It includes, for example, sales forecasts, business, product or marketing plans, computer programs, software and other inventions or developments (regardless of the stage of development), customer lists, prospects, financial information, business practices and intellectual property.
Confidential Information is information that is not generally known outside the company about Phelix, its customers (including data/information that our customers provide us or upload into our service), employees or other parties with which the Company has a relationship. It also includes, for example, financial information, personally identifiable information, legally privileged communications and materials, and the existence and terms of agreements with customers or counterparties.
Our responsibilities extend beyond not revealing Phelix’s Confidential or Proprietary Information – we must also:
properly secure, label and (when appropriate) dispose of such material;
safeguard confidential information that Phelix receives from others under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs);
 1376

 take steps to keep our trade secrets and other confidential intellectual property secret;
Only sharing certain information once we have an NDA in place with an outside party (please the NDA Guide).
Handling Confidential and Proprietary Information
Make sure that information that is classified as “Need to Know” or “Confidential” in Phelix’s Data Classification Guidelines is handled in accordance with those Guidelines and Phelix’s Data Security Policy. At times, a particular project or negotiation may require you to disclose Need to Know or Confidential or Proprietary information to an outside party - please consult your manager or privacy@phelix.ai prior to disclosing such information. Disclosure of that information should be on an “only as needed” basis and only under a non-disclosure agreement. Be sure to conduct the appropriate due diligence and have the appropriate agreement in place before you disclose the information. If you’re in a gray area, be cautious and ask for guidance from privacy@phelix.ai.
You should be aware that your duty of confidentiality applies during and even after your employment or relationship with the company ends. You may not take Proprietary or Confidential Information with you when leaving Phelix or use or disclose such information for your own personal benefit or for the benefit of a new employer or prospective new employer. The Company will pursue legal remedies for any unauthorized disclosures of Proprietary and Confidential Information.
Phelix Partners and Third Parties
Just as we are careful not to disclose Phelix’s Confidential and Proprietary Information, it’s equally important not to disclose any Confidential Information from our partners and other third parties with whom we do business.
At times, individuals or other companies may volunteer their Confidential Information regarding their business plans or product in seeking a business relationship with the Company. At other times, we may ask that a third party provide us with Confidential Information to allow us to evaluate a potential business relationship with that party. Don’t accept confidential information from other companies without first having all parties sign an appropriate non-disclosure agreement approved by legal (please reach out to sara@phelix.ai). Remember that an unintentional disclosure of Confidential Information can be just as harmful as an intentional one so exercise good judgment in handling all Confidential Information, whether it belongs to Phelix, our partners or other third parties.
Outside Communications and Research
You now know that our policy is to be extremely careful about disclosing Confidential and Proprietary information. Consistent with that, you should also ensure your outside communications (including online and social media posts) do not disclose Confidential or Proprietary information or represent (or otherwise give the impression) that you are speaking on behalf of Phelix (unless you’re authorized to do so by the company). Please check with sara@phelix.ai before accepting any public speaking engagement on behalf of the company. In general, before making any external communication or disclosure, you should consult our Employee Communications Policy and our Communications and Disclosure Policy.
Protection and Proper Use of Phelix’s Property Assets
Company assets and property may be used only for legitimate business purposes, and you should take appropriate safeguards to prevent misuse, loss, or theft. Company assets are both tangible and intangible, and include intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrighted materials, business and marketing plans, engineering and design documents and ideas, company records, salary and evaluation information, and any financial data and reports. Unauthorized use, alteration, destruction, disclosure, possession, or distribution of Phelix’s assets violates company policy and this Code of Conduct. The data that customers have entrusted to the Phelix are also a company asset, and you should in every instance follow our policies regarding access to and use of that data
Intellectual Property
Phelix’s intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets. Unauthorized use can lead to their loss or serious loss of value. You must respect all copyright and other intellectual property laws, including laws governing the fair use of copyrights, trademarks, and brands. You must never use Phelix’s logos, marks, or other protected information or property unless you are permitted to do so for your role
   1377

 at Phelix. Use for any business or commercial venture is strictly prohibited. We strongly encourage you to report any suspected misuse of trademarks, logos, or other Phelix intellectual property to legal@phelix.ai.
Likewise, respect the intellectual property rights of others. Inappropriate use of others’ intellectual property may expose Phelix and you to criminal and civil fines and penalties. Please seek advice from sara@phelix.ai before you solicit, accept, or use proprietary information from individuals outside the company or let them use or have access to Phelix proprietary information.
Company Equipment
Phelix gives you the tools and equipment you need to do your job effectively, but we count on you to be responsible with these tools and equipment. Company funds, equipment and assets are not to be used for personal use. Not sure if a certain use of company assets is okay? Please reach out to people-ops@phelix.ai.
Phelix’s communication tools (which include both our network and the hardware that uses it, like computers and mobile devices) are a critical aspect of our company’s property. Be sure to follow all security policies. Please make sure you always secure your laptop and other company devices. Don’t tamper with or disable security and safety devices. If you have any reason to believe that our network security has been violated – for example, you lose your laptop or think that your network password may have been compromised – please promptly report the incident to security@phelix.ai or any member of the leadership team.
Please be aware that anything you do using Phelix’s equipment or network (e.g., our computers, mobile devices, etc.) might be disclosed to people inside and outside the company. The company may monitor, access and disclose employee communications and other information on our corporate electronic facilities or on our premises where there is a business need to do so, such as protecting employees and users, maintaining the security of resources and property, or investigating suspected employee misconduct.
Financial Integrity and Responsibility
Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of corporate professionalism. Accurate and reliable financial and business records are of critical importance in meeting the Phelix’s financial, legal, and business obligations. Always keep in mind that the money we spend on behalf of Phelix is not ours; it’s the company’s and, ultimately, our shareholders’. Each person at Phelix has a role in making sure that money is appropriately spent, our financial records are complete and accurate and internal controls are honored. This matters every time we hire a new vendor, expense something to Phelix, sign a new business contract or enter into any deals. you should never falsify any record or account, including time reports, expense accounts and any other Phelix records.
Below are some key principles that are fundamental to our financial integrity and fiscal responsibility at Phelix.
Expenses
When you submit an expense for reimbursement or spend money on Phelix’s behalf, make sure that the expense was pre-approved by your manager and that the cost is reasonable, directly related to company business, and supported by appropriate documentation (ex. receipts).
Signing a Contract
Each time you enter into a business transaction on Phelix’s behalf, there should be documentation recording that agreement, pre-approved in writing by legal (reach out to legal@phelix.ai or directly to sara@phelix.ai). Signing a contract on behalf of Phelix is a very big deal and has many implications. Never sign any contract on behalf of Phelix unless you have been explicitly authorized to be a signatory on behalf of the company and have approval to sign the particular contract by legal.
All contracts at Phelix should be in writing and should contain all of the relevant terms to which the parties are agreeing. Phelix strictly prohibits “side agreements,” oral or written.
      1378

 Document Retention
It’s important that we keep records and documents for an appropriate length of time. Please do not delete or discard any company records or documents without approval from your manager or someone on the leadership team.
Comply with the Law
Phelix takes its responsibilities to comply with laws and regulations very seriously and each of us is expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and prohibitions. While you’re not expected to know all aspects of every applicable law, you should understand the major laws and regulations that apply to your work.
Anti-bribery Laws
Like all businesses, Phelix is subject to laws that prohibit bribery in virtually every kind of commercial setting. The rule is simple – don’t bribe anybody, anytime, for any reason. This means you must not directly or indirectly (through a partner or other third party) promise, offer, approve or make payment of money or anything of value to anyone, including a government official, agent, or employee of a government, political party, or business entity, with the intent to induce favorable business treatment or to improperly affect business or government decisions.
Government officials
Offering gifts, entertainment or other business courtesies that could be perceived as bribes becomes especially problematic if you’re dealing with a government official. Laws in Canada and around the world specifically prohibit offering or giving anything of value to government officials to influence official action or to secure an improper advantage.
Conclusion
Phelix aspires to be a company that is ethical, equitable and an innovative leader in healthcare. It is not possible for this Code of Conduct to spell out every potential ethical situation we might face. So, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity for ourselves and our company. Please take guidance from both the letter and the spirit of this Code of Conduct. Sometimes, it’s not easy to determine the right thing to do. If you aren’t sure, don’t hesitate to ask for help by reaching out to sara@phelix.ai or any member of the leadership team. And if you see something that you think isn’t right, please say something ! Drop a note to any member of the leadership team or reach out to people-ops@phelix.ai.

Phelix Internal Onboarding Checklist (OSCAR) https://forms.gle/Bvva7uHWbEPHPza78
Workflow / Deployment Details
1. we no longer operate a walk in clinic so we don’t have to worry about that
2. we have 5 family physicians and one “extra” MD (Dr. Potiuk) who will see overflow on Tuesday afternoons only:
1462

 Dr. Trevor Mailey
Dr. Nomailla Memon
Dr. Peter Samcoe
Dr. Francois Oosthuizen Dr. Michael Putland
1. Incoming phone calls from patients tend to be on 3 main lines:
250-391-7554 for Mailey/Memon/Samcoe 250-478-1796 for Putland
250-478-3211 for Oosthuizen
1. Regular office hours are 8-4 for all offices on Monday - Friday with some individual variations
2. After hours, on call physician must be reachable by accessing the above noted numbers so we need to ensure there is a process that
accommodates that and stops nuisance calls from getting through to the physician on call
3. The inbox assistant: I need to ensure there will be no mistakes in filing of documents that are coming in. They also need to be directed to each of the physicians to whom they are addressed. Anything that does not match up will need to be flagged for attention and manual labelling and direction to the appropriate physician. We cannot have any loose ends here, it must be failsafe.
4. Virtual agent/Online booking of appointments:
when a patient calls the above numbers or goes online, they should be able to book an appointment automatically with their assigned provider only.
-MDs will need to decide what types of visits they will allow patients to book (for example, I will start with only allowing telephone
consults to be booked without talking to my MOA and I will allot a certain number per day).
-all bookings should receive a confirmation of the booking.
-All patients should, when booking, receive a reminder about COVID symptoms that would trigger for them to cancel an in office appointment
-All patients, prior to an in office visit, should have to complete a COVID symptom checklist to receive clearance to attend
-I would like patients to receive a reminder of their upcoming appointment 1 week prior and 1 day prior to their visit (in or out of office) -when patients arrive they should be able to check in from their car and be notified when the office is ready to receive them for in office
appointments. It would be nice if they could have a text message that lets them know when they are “next in line”.
-at the current time none of us are taking new patients, however, in the future there may be a need to have “new” patients fill out an
information form online that could be screened for best fit with a MD
1. Not sure what you would need from me in order to create the e-Form builder.
a. We will need training for all MOAs/docs and a testing platform so we can see how it looks

 Meadowlands Example - Email Template To Send After The Initial Customer Call
Once all parameters are defined (checkpoints cadence, confirmations/cancellations, status codes, COVID screening verbiage etc.) here is what I send:
Hi XXX,
Thank you for joing the call, it was great learning more about your workflows and we are excited to get this going for you!
Please see below the summary of what we went through, including the current configuration, as wel as to-do’s for [CLINIC NAME]
[example of Meadowlands below, please adjust accordingly]
To-do’s for [CLINIC NAME]'s team
1. Please review below checkpoints/text messages and the COVID screener, and confirm the current verbiage / configuration is as expected. Let us know if you prefer that we jump on a quick call and go through this together! Once confirmed, we can go live when you are back in the office next week!
2. Please send us your logo (I was unable to find it on your website) - which we can use in the COVID screener and online booking forms
3. Please send us the form for an 18-month checkup, so we can review it and add to Phelix
4. List of doctors, indicating which ones are family doctors and which ones are for urgent care.
5. Discuss and adjust schedule template codes for appointments that require different duration (like mental health) - once this is ready, we can discuss online booking and IVR more in detail
1. Checkpoints / Text Messages
Patients will receive messages once the appointment is booked, XX hours and XX hours before their appointment time (which doesn't have option to cancel and includes a link for the COVID screener - only for in-person appointments)
Please review the verbiage for the following checkpoints: i. Time of Booking (In-Person) - scheduled with "To Do"
      1495

 if a patient replies "1", this will automatically change the status in the EMR to "Confirmed"
 if a patient replies "2", this will automatically change the status in the EMR to "Cancelled"
 ii. 48-Hour Reminder (In-Person) - scheduled with "To Do"
   iii. 24-Hour Reminder (In-Person) - scheduled with "To Do"
   iv. Time of Booking (Phone) - scheduled with "Phone Call Appointment"
  1496

  if a patient replies "1", this will automatically change the status in the EMR to "Confirmed - Phone Call Appt"
 if a patient replies "2", this will automatically change the status in the EMR to "Cancelled"
 v. 48-Hour Reminder (Phone) - scheduled with "Phone Call Appointment"
   vi. 24-Hour Reminder (Phone) - scheduled with "Phone Call Appointment"
   1497

 2. COVID Screener
We created 2 COVID screeners:
1. For the existing patients (which they will be getting in 24-hr reminders): https://app.blockhealth.co/form_view/105
2. Everyone else (sales reps, delivery guys, etc.): https://app.blockhealth.co/form_view/106
The difference between two is that the one for the existing patients will be looking for a patient chart in the EMR, and will change the status after the screening, while the other one won't.
Please find attached QR codes that you can put on your door / front desk.
Current questions (let us know if anything needs to be tweaked):
1. Are you experiencing any of the following symptoms: fever, shortness of breath, cough, or loss of taste? 2. Have you travelled to any countries outside Canada in the last 14 days?
3. Did you provide care or have close contact with anyone with a confirmed Covid-19 case?
If a patient passes the screening, the status in the EMR will also update to "COVID Screener Passed". They will see the following (and will receive a text message):
If a patient passes the screening, the status in the EMR will also update to "COVID Screener Failed". They will see the following (and will receive a text message):
   1498

  3. Virtual Agent
Please find attached the Virtual Agent script, for a review - all verbiage is in blue/purple, but I also highlighted important sections so you can easily spot them. Once schedule template codes are ready, we can hop on the call and discuss more in detail.
Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help with anything else in the interim! Best,
 1499

 Acton Example - Email Template To Send After The Initial Customer Call
Once all parameters are defined (checkpoints cadence, confirmations/cancellations, status codes, COVID screening verbiage etc.) here is what I send:
Hi XXX,
Thank you for joing the call, it was great learning more about your workflows and we are excited to get this going for you!
Please see below the summary of what we went through, including the current configuration, as wel as to-do’s for [CLINIC NAME]
[example of Acton below, please adjust accordingly]
To-do’s for [CLINIC NAME]'s team
1. Please review below online booking forms, checkpoints/text messages and COVID screener (+ Virtual Agent script in the attachment), and confirm the current verbiage / configuration is as expected. Let us know if you prefer that we jump on a quick call and go through this together! Once confirmed, we can go live with this part!
2. Please send us your logo (I was unable to find it on your website) - which we can use in the COVID screener and online booking forms3. It seems that the credentials for SrFax are not working - we can go through this on the call, as we would need this information to be able to integrate
1. Online Booking Forms
Here is the link for Schedule Guide in OSCAR: https://worldoscar.org/knowledge-base/schedule-management/ . Please review the "Schedule Setting" section - first a template needs to be created (section "Template Setting") before setting up a schedule. Thank you so much for your help on setting this up on your end!
We created 2 forms for now:
1. In-person appointments https://app.blockhealth.co/form_view/113 1. Phone appointments https://app.blockhealth.co/form_view/114
Please be free to test them, here is how they are setup currently:

Appt"

 Workflow Descriptions
1523

 Inbox Assistant - Workflow Description
 Phelix’s industry leading healthcare document AI is specifically built to triage incoming faxes, prior to entering or uploading them into the EMR. Once we connect your incoming fax lines into Phelix’s fax inbox channel, new faxes are triaged by the AI, before staff anyone has had to physically review it, helping save 75% of time uploading, entering, and assigning them in the EMR.
In addition to incoming faxes, Phelix’s omni-channel inbox can be used to centralize the triaging and processing of incoming e-Referrals, e- mail, chat, phone calls, and other web inquiries, or integrate alongside existing tools as required (e.g. Ocean e-Referrals).
Automated fax notifications can be sent to referring providers when referrals are received, declined, or booked, as well as to request any specific missing items (e.g. provider billing code).
Phelix’s document AI helps to automate manual and time consuming tasks such as classifying and naming documents, extracting and tagging patients, from- or to- providers, insurance details, capturing chief complaints, medications, allergies, flagging urgent faxes, and more. It consists of the following models and pipelines:
Document classification (e.g. cover page, referral letter, labs, imaging note, consult note, admin note, prescriptions etc) Template classification (e.g. pre-trained by clinics for common templates)
Entity extraction and EMR search (e.g. Extracting patient demographics and searching or creating a new patient in the EMR) Priority Detection (e.g. Identifying STAT / Urgent faxes for staff to review first)
Clinical extraction (e.g. capturing chief complaint, medication list, allergies, conditions etc)
Custom form and checkbox detection (ex. Requisition form for reason for referral or requested procedure)
1524

 Patient Journey Automation - Workflow Description
 Phelix’s Automation Builder is used to create event-driven automations across any channel or interface, customizing and refining parameters such as:
Trigger type (e.g. External API, appointments, documents, referrals, or custom flags)
Filters and cohorts (e.g. conditions, appointment type, document type)
Actions (e.g. send an outgoing SMS, e-mail, fax HL7 message, phone call, make an update in the EMR)
Campaign and tracking (e.g. View campaigns linked to an automation, focused on tracking key outcomes, such as delivery rate, link clicks, and other outcomes).
Waiting room notifications (e.g. sending SMS to patients once they check-in, or based on their position in waiting room queue)
Phelix’s Form Builder is used to create and customize mini web apps or experiences that can be delivered to patients using the automation builder above, embedded into websites, or can be accessed via QR codes or kiosks on site. Forms can be secured using SMS or E-mail based one-time passwords, so patients don't need to remember another portal and password. There are a variety of general and specialty specific form templates available, including:
Simple or complex scheduling workflows (e.g. Scheduling pathways for Cardiology intake)
Smart consent capture (e.g. Only show MRI screening for MRI procedures)
Patient intake and custom screenings (e.g. COVID screening)
Automated self check-in (i.e Patients using kiosk or tablet to check themselves in, as long as there are no flags, such as missing req form)
Patient card capture (e.g. Health card, Insurance card, Drivers licence)
Payment capture for services and subscriptions (e.g. selecting and paying for out-of-pocket services) Securely delivering reports, images, or other messages and attachments to patients
1525

 Patients are able to access intuitive and contextual mobile, desktop and tablet experiences, delivered via their channel of choice, without needing to login and navigate a bulky portal or interface. For secure workflows, instead of having to remember another password, the Phelix forms can easily activate one time password, which will deliver a 4 digit code to the patient via SMS or Email, which then needs to be entered to secure the form session and ensure compliance.
When at the clinic, patients are able to use onsite kiosks or tablets to check themselves in, including completing any outstanding forms in line, and will receive contextual SMS messages updating them with their position in queue, up until its time for them to enter the room.
Key elements within the automation and form builders are able to interact bi-directionality with the EMR, and in real-time. As long as API interfaces are available, we are able to connect any endpoint or function within the EMR to an automation or a form. Some examples include:
Syncing appointments or pulling appointment slots with the EMR, for patient self booking workflows Allowing patients to confirming, cancelling, or rescheduling appointments in the EMR
Updating the status of an appointment or referral based on a specific patient action
Uploading the summary PDF of completed forms or consents into the patient's chart in the EMR Triggering an automation based on the creation of a form, letter, or note
Triggering an automation based on a certain document, referral or appointment type created in the EMR
1526

 Virtual Agent - Workflow Description
 Phelix’s Virtual Agent provides the ability to automated inbound flows across all existing or new channels, including phone lines, SMS, website chatbot, or web form, and can be fully integrated with your EMR. Phelix’s intuitive flow builder can be used to customize each flow to meet the clinic's needs and workflow. Some pre-built flows and components include:
Real-time patient search and patient verification in the EMR
Various appointment booking scenarios (e.g. family doctor, walk-in, referral booking, specialist follow-up) in the EMR Appointment confirmation, cancellation, and rescheduling in the EMR
Connect to automation builder and trigger outgoing SMS from inbound flows (e.g. Receive an online booking link via SMS) Office hour handling for forwarding to clinic staff (e.g. only forward to staff during clinic hours, or play closed message) Screenings and satisfaction surveys
Common and Custom FAQs for your clinic
The phone agent can be used to triage and deflect up to 50% of incoming phone calls, including a significant chunk of appointment bookings. The phone agent is currently powered by IVR (interactive voice response), but we are soon layering in Phelix’s conversational AI, which is able to understand and action requests without any keypad inputs. Calls that can not be fully automated are forwarded back to staff for further review.
The website chatbot can be embedded into your website, and allows your patients and website visitors to engage and automate many of the common requests and flows built above. The website chatbot leverages Phelix’s conversational AI, and is able to understand common patient requests over 80% of the time.
1527

 Using the relevant inbox channel, staff can see call logs of all incoming calls or conversations, including those that require further follow-up. Additional details can also be tracked in the patient timeline.

 Phelix Positioning Statements
Pitch Phelix in 1 line:
Phelix is an is AI powered, omni-channel, and low code virtual assistant for healthcare workflows
Pitch Phelix in 2-3 lines:
Phelix uses AI, intelligent automation, and low code builders to automate and connect healthcare workflows across the patient journey, including faxes, phone, SMS, email, scheduling, prior authorizations, payments, and more. Our industry leading solutions automate and win back 1000's of hours daily for healthcare providers across North America.
Problem Solution:
Over the last 50 years, the number of physicians has grown by about 200% (so it’s roughly doubled or 2X). Over that same time period, the number of admin staff to support care delivery has grown by over 4000% (so 40X), largely driven by the manual and burdensome workflow and processes associated with silo’d, disconnected, and fragmented health systems.
As a result, 90%+ of healthcare communication today is by fax (or efax) and phone. Despite many attempts to dislodge them, they remain a critical part of almost every healthcare encounter. Every clinic and healthcare provider has a fax number and phone number, and every patient has a phone number. In a risk averse environment, the fax and phone are the ubiquitous communication channels that trump solutions such as e-referral, e-messaging, and care collaboration platforms or patient portals, which face many technical and change management related barriers to adoption.
And it also leaves us in an interesting place where healthcare providers, their staff, and patients collectively end up as ‘routers’, frustratingly trying to bridge the gaps in an often complex and disconnected journey.
For providers, this results in opaque communications, especially around patient handoffs and transfers of care. For patients, it means difficulties accessing care, longer wait times, and from time to time, critical outcomes resulting from admin errors.
At Phelix, thinking different is in our DNA. We believe it's faster to automate around the edge of current silos (e.g. EMR, EHR, RIS, LIS, PMS etc) and their existing channels, with a particular focus on automating fax and phone workflows, followed by an API first approach to rebuild the healthcare delivery stack for secure, connected and intelligent health systems of the future.
Describing Phelix:
Phelix uses AI, intelligent automation, and API’s to solve complex fragmentation challenges, while winning back significant time and improving workflows for providers and staff at clinics, hospital, health systems, and communities at large.
At the core, it is a highly configurable workflow engine thats powered by ‘zero code’ intelligent automation tools layered on cloud & telecom infrastructure. Our solutions can be deployed as ‘out-of the box’ EMR add-ons, with the option to visualize workflows, work-lists, and
1549

 analytics within our dashboards or leverage our API’s to embed and power solutions directly from within the EMR, care coordination portals, or patient portals.
Value Statement (for Clinics):
Phelix is an AI powered clinical assistant that wins back over 75% of time spent on repetitive administrative, patient flow and clinical tasks while moving the needle on access, satisfaction, and turnaround metrics.
Product Descriptions
Inbox Assistant:
Phelix’s Inbox Assistant utilizes AI to sort, process, and triage incoming faxes, before staff anyone has had to physically review it, and uploads them into the relevant EMR inbox for review. It helps to automate manual and time consuming tasks such classifying and naming documents, extracting relevant dates, extracting and tagging patients, from- or to- providers, insurance plans and id’s, capturing chief complaints, medications, allergies, flagging STAT or urgent faxes, and more. Use cases range from simple EMR tagging and filing into patient charts, to triaging and populating charts and orders from new referrals.
Patient Journey Automation:
Phelix’s Patient Journey Automation is the most comprehensive and customizable tool to build and control patient & provider engagement across individual encounter flows, campaigns, or across the whole patient journey. Unlike other solutions on the market, it provides full control over triggers, filtering logic, messaging, and secure and password free EMR integrated smart forms, powering use cases ranging from simple SMS and Email reminders, to complex scheduling, custom screenings, registration, report distribution, payments, surveys, and more. The automation builder also allows staff to configure self-check-in, registration, waiting room, and wayfinding workflows, reducing friction and wait-times, while ensuring a seamless patient experience on the day of appointment.
Virtual Assistant:
Phelix’s Virtual Assistant is a smart agent that integrates with ALL existing or new inbound communication channels (phone line, website, SMS etc), and helps your clinic triage and automate incoming patient and provider requests, leveraging either interactive voice responses and trees, or a chatbot that uses conversational AI. Some request that can be fully automated include appointment bookings, confirmations, cancellations, and rescheduling, checking status updates on referrals and test results, as well as general FAQ’s. All other requests are forwarded back for reception, and the clinic remains in full control of building and updating the flows in real-time.
Developer APIs (2-3 lines):
Power your workflows with Phelix.
Together with a set of no-code builders, our developer API's help healthcare developers automate and connect fragmented patient and provider journeys, 10x faster, and with as little code as possible.
We help build, connect, and deploy secure, scalable, and event-driven automations, features, or delightful digital experiences into your EMR, digital health app, virtual care platform, patient or provider portal, and other applications.
Document API:
Phelix’s intelligent document processing (IDP) API’s are designed, developed, and tuned specifically for processing healthcare faxes and other clinical records, and provide industry leading ‘out of the box’ accuracies for certain manual and time consuming tasks, such classifying, sorting, and naming documents, extracting relevant dates, extracting and tagging patients, from- or to- providers, insurance plans and id’s, capturing chief complaints, medications, allergies, flagging STAT or urgent faxes, and more. Use cases range from filing
 1550

 faxes into patient charts and provider inboxes for review, triaging and populating charts and orders from new referrals, or sorting and classifying large clinical records, and cleansing/pre-processing the record prior to ingestion into clinical NLP engines.
Directory API:
Conversation API:
Phelix Conversational AI APIs serves as a toolkit to build your own patient or physician facing virtual assistant or chatbot.
Automation API:
Phelix's Automation API's provide highly flexible tools to build, connect, and deploy secure, scalable, and event-driven automations into your patient journey, including the ability to embed minimalist and delightful digital experiences and features into your EMR, digital health app, virtual care platform, patient portal, and other applications or workflows.

 Weekly Sync - Squad Lead
June 4, 2021
Points to discuss
Test-driven development
Production issue documentation for future references, with their respective solutions Development process
Architecture design needs to be discussed for new epic or story with the architect Note-taking during the discussion in Confluence and tag stakeholders
Definition of readiness
Stories should have well-defined acceptance criteria
Scope and priority should be defined
Necessary design changes should be discussed and documented in Confluence Each squad should have its own Confluence page
Definition of Done (DoD)
Implementation should be done by following coding guidelines
Code should be reviewed
A merge request should have unit test cases and integration test cases
Audit utility service
Authentication and authorization flow Release process
Production code should be present in the master branch; for any new release (with less scope) or hotfix, we should create a new hotfix or release branch from master
When creating a release branch, we need to increment the microservice version by following semantic version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
MAJOR – for making incompatible API changes,
MINOR – for adding a functionality in a backward-compatible manner; and PATCH – for making backward-compatible bug fixes.
Release code should be deployed in UAT for testing, using a tag number: version-UAT (version-microservice version)
Once testing is completed we will promote the same tag to the production

  Combined Pipeline
The combined pipeline extracts and returns useful admin information in unstructured clinical documents.
It classifies medical documents into different classes and templates based on the content, as well the structure of the document.
Using NLP, it detects entities — textual references to medical information, such as protected patient information, referral/from information, patient insurance information, and the reason and diagnosis.
It enables users to link these detected entities to standardized medical knowledge bases, such as CPT and ICD codes through ontology linking operations.
Relevant classes and entities:
Document classes: Admin Note
Clinical History And Summary Consult Note
Cover Page
Imaging Note
Insurance Authorization Intake Forms
Lab Test
Other

  Clinical Pipeline
The clinical pipeline extracts and processes pertinent clinical information (e.g., report dates) from documents—particularly, those with physician writings.
It classifies the medical documents into different classes and subclasses based on the content of the document.
Using NLP, it semantically segments the clinical text into subregions and processes the information in the subregions to extract the important tags, using AWS Medical Comprehend.
Clinical Subregions:
Clinical Allergies
Clinical Past Surgical History Clinical Family History
Clinical Examination
Clinical History of Present Illness Clinical Social History
Clinical Past Medical History
1570

 Clinical Obgyn History Clinical Medications
Clinical Preventive Medicine Clinical Screening Pathology Report
OUTPUT: a JSON file containing the document class, document subclass, physician name, report date, raw clinical text, raw clinical subregion text, and AWS comprehend medical tags.

Description:
Productionizing and scaling Python ML workloads simply | Ray
Ray ML is a toolkit built using Ray Core for distributed ML workloads.
Ray ML offers the Ray Serve library, which is an easy-to-use scalable model serving library built on Ray Core.
The significant benefit of using ray is that it enables the creation of multi-model inference pipelines (also referred to as Model Composition) which are accessible using the ServeHandle API provided by the library.
Ray Serve can be deployed anywhere from a Personal Computer to a K8 Cluster.
Deployment on K8 Cluster requires that a ray operator and custom resource be set up before any deployments.
Progress:
Refactored the current server code into standalone ray deployments which are accessible both via ServeHandle API and the link to it Successfully implemented and ran ray serve on a standalone PC
Local Ray-Cluster on Minikube:
Successfully initialized ray-cluster and operator on a minikube cluster initialised locally
Created a custom docker image to port all the packages and dependencies required by the codebase to the cluster Submitted deployments to the cluster to start all the endpoints
DocNER pipeline runtime: ~9.5s
Cloud Ray-Cluster Setup:
Unable to initialize the required cluster and workers on the GKE Cluster.
cannot initialize because the operator does not have permission to get the status of GKE. reached out to Ray on Ray Discuss and Stackoverflow for resolving this.

  Ad-hoc toggling of the compute device value from cpu to cuda:0 suggests significant performance improvement for several models. Ideally, we should be able to load all the models into GPU and call it a day. But my local machine’s GPU memory is limited to 8GB, so is our infrastructure dev machine. So, I tried a few variations of combined CPU and GPU computations, with good results. The benchmark code is available in misc/benchmark.py file.
Comparison of Average response times
Here’s the comparison of average response times for tested combinations(NOTE: the response times are adjusted with textract_proxy response times for fair comparison.):

Redis issue: clear redis cache and ensure redis is not running on spot vm. Also the cluster’s allocated resources should be sufficient enough (20GB Memory minimum) to handle large volume of tasks.
Reseller-service communication issue: Ensure minimum of 7 pods running for reseller service. Though during the stress test connectivity issue did not resolve 100% but performance was satisfactory.
Model-service pod readiness issue: Dynamic queue implementation was scaling up concurrent request based on number of available Model-service pods. But all available model-service pods can not handle incoming request, only the pods those are in ready state can serve

 request. To solve the issue dynamic queue implementation has been modified so that scaling logic now works based on available and ready Model-service pods.
List of all the issues and their solution we faced:
None of the model services were scaling
The consensus had not been stress tested before. When testing was carried out, it turned out that the model services were not scaling (no matter the load the number of pods would be 1). Additionally, increasing the minReplicas was also not working (when the model services would run only 1 pod even though the minReplicas was set to higher). It turned out that there were slight differences between the kserve installation on consensus compared to dev.
The kserve installation was updated, however due to permissions issues the update was not complete. It was noticed that the model services were partially scaled at this point. After getting the permissions, the kserve update was completed, however the model services scaled back down to 1 (irrespective of the number of minReplicas set). Everything was updated on consensus to reflect the dev environment but still, the model services would not scale beyond 1. The only difference between the dev and consensus was the service account used. On inspection, the model services were using certificate-based authentication using the service account. A new service account was created and the google service account credentials were passed to it using the google_authentication.json file. This worked and the model services started scaling afterwards.
List of possible things which worked:
