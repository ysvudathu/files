Referral & Auth Status Mapping
Referral Status
Referral Incomplete

Referral status = incomplete

Incomplete for 2 reasons : 

Missing items (incomplete status = missing items)

notification sent to referring provider 

If Recondo Eligibility Integration is OFF (i.e. simple Canadian case)

button in UI for staff ‘Complete’

click complete, referral status = received

If recondo Eligibility integration is ON 

button in UI for staff : Eligibility Check

once clicked → Referral status = received 

Send to recondo eligibility check

Eligibility = false (incomplete status = eligibilty false)

Go in Incomplete with Eligibility Status False 

Patient receives notification + self pay option 

if patient self pays, auth status = Self pay, and drop into Booking Queue

if patient pays =  booking checkpoint (triggered once patient has paid)

once patient books = Referral Booked

 

Referral Received / Triage

Referral status = received

if recondo Eligibility integration is ON

Send to recondo for eligibility check (Relay error to the front end - block creation referral)

‘Book Appointment’ button in UI

if appointment manually booked, or appointment booked from EMR, update referral status = booked (move to Booked tab)

if ‘AutoBook’ selected, trigger Auto-Book checkpoint and move to referral status = in Booking (Booking queue) → Implement later 

If Recondo Eligibility Integration is ON

if false 

Referral status = incomplete

Incomplete status = eligibility false

see workflow above

True (whether initially or once updated)

patient moves into Booking Queue 

Booking Queue (Referral Ready to be Booked)

Referral status = in Booking

If Recondo Auth integration is ON - Introduce column for Auth Status. If Recondo Auth integration is OFF - auth status = N/A, and HIDE Auth status column

possible Auth status values (from load account)

self pay 

N/A or Auth not required (status NA or NR). If Recondo Integration is OFF, Auth status = N/A (and hide auth status column in Booking Tab).

Auth required 

Once patient books (Auth review + deep link worklist only populated once patient books)

Referral status = Booked

if auth status is self-pay =  Referral is Booked 

if auth status is N/A or not required = move to Referral is Booked 

if auth status is required  = move to Auth Review I Tab (needs deep link)

if auth status is initiated = move to Auth Review II Tab

 

Referral in Auth Review I (tab only visible is Recondo Auth Integration is ON)

Referral status = Booked

1 auth status type

Auth status = Auth required (Deeplink button)

Once deeplink initiated (response method tbd with Recondo)

Auth status = Auth initiated

Move to Auth review II

 

Referral in Auth Review II (tab only visible if Recondo Auth Integration is ON)

Referral status = Booked

1 Auth status type 

Auth status = ‘Auth Initiated’

Introduce Auth Review Status

Pending (no status update)

Last auth review status response from Recondo table 

Add Auth review status code as checkpoints

Denied cases

Reschedule cases

Checkpoint builder inclusion criteria (if last status is NF x hours before appointment). Define list of status, and x

Referral Booked/Accepted

Referral status = Booked

if auth status is self-pay =  Referral is Booked 

if auth status is N/A or not required = move to Referral is Booked 

if auth status is auth required  = move to Auth Review I Tab 

if auth status is auth initiated = move to Auth Review II Tab

Now listening to Recondo Surepay for estimates

Once we have estimate, we send registration

Once the appointment is booked, move here / view switches to daylist

Self Pay

Send the Registration Form

No more status changes required

Auth Status is N/A

If booked and auth is not req

Send the Registration Form

No more status changes required

Auth Status is N/A

If auth is required

Once auth initiated (deep link)

Wait for TOS payment (SurePay?)

Send Registration Form with TOS payment (Registration bound to payment)

Workflow switches to appointment status (e.g. Oscar) or appointment attributes (e.g. Accuro) b/w Referral Booked and Visit Complete –  will be in Referral MX

If Time of Booking checkpoint is sent w/ Intermediate Status, then Appointment Status = Intermediate Status and if not Appointment Status = NA (or NULL)

Appointment Status Values (Appointment MX)

NA or NULL

Awaiting Notification

Awaiting Confirmation

Notified

Confirmed

Checked-in 

In-room

Visit Complete

Images Ready (specific to imaging)

Report Ready

Appointment Attribute Values (Appointment MX)

Notified - y/n

Confirmed y/n

Registered - y/n

Payment - y/n/partial

Checked-in - y/n

In-room - y/n

Visit Complete - y/n

Images Ready (specific to imaging) - y/n

Report Ready - y/n

Referral Ready/Registered 

Registration complete

Payment complete (y/partial)

Status controlled at the Referral level and not at the appointment level, however, for single appointment referrals, status will change at the appointment level

But for now as we are combining registration and referral to one step in the workflow, this status will still change

Visit Complete or Visits Complete

Status changes from In-room to Visit Complete if only one appointment in referral

Status updates from In-room to Visit Complete after all appointments complete

After visit is complete

Can be multiple visits under one referral

Images Ready

Report Ready

When report is ready

Report Sent

After report is sent
